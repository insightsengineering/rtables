# Reporting an Issue with rtables

Do not use this form to ask a question, or ask for assistance. Instead, ask on [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) using the `nest-rtables` tag. Questions about a function's use will be closed without a response.

Please briefly describe your problem and, when relevant, the output you expect.
Please also provide the output of `utils::sessionInfo()` or
`devtools::session_info()` at the end of your post.

If at all possible, please include a [minimal, reproducible
example](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963269/how-to-make-a-great-r-reproducible-example).
The `rtables` team will be much more likely to resolve your issue if they are
able to reproduce it themselves locally.

Please delete this preamble after you have read it.
