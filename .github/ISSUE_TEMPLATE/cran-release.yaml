        ### Prepare the release

        - [ ] Create a new release candidate branch
          `git checkout -b release-candidate-vX.Y.Z`
        - [ ] Update NEWS.md file: make sure it reflects a holistic summary of what has changed in the package.
        - [ ] Remove the additional fields (`Remotes`) from the DESCRIPTION file where applicable.
        - [ ] Make sure that the minimum dependency versions are updated in the DESCRIPTION file for the package and its reverse dependencies (Optional).
          - [ ] Increase versioned dependency on {package name} to >=X.Y.Z (Optional).
        - [ ] Commit your changes and create the PR on GitHub (add "[skip vbump]" in the PR title). Add all updates, commit, and push changes:
          `# Make the necessary modifications to your files
          # Stage the changes
          git add <files your modified>
          # Commit the changes
          git commit -m "[skip vbump] <Your commit message>"
          git push origin release-candidate-vX.Y.Z`

        ### Test the release

        - [ ] Execute the manual tests on Shiny apps that are deployed on various hosting providers (Posit connect and shinyapps.io) - track the results in GitHub issue (Applicable only for frameworks that use Shiny).
        - [ ] Monitor integration tests, if integration fails, create priority issues on the board.
        - [ ] Execute UAT tests (Optional).

        ### CRAN submission

        - [ ] Tag the update(s) as a release candidate vX.Y.Z-rc<iteration-number> (e.g. v0.5.3-rc1) on the release candidate branch (release-candidate-vX.Y.Z).
          `# Create rc tag for submission for internal validation
          git tag vX.Y.Z-rc<iteration number>
          git push origin vX.Y.Z-rc<iteration number>`
        - [ ] Build the package locally using the command:`R CMD build .` which will generate a .tar.gz file necessary for the CRAN submission.
        - [ ] Submit the package to https://win-builder.r-project.org/upload.aspx for testing, for more details please see "Building and checking R source packages for Windows": https://win-builder.r-project.org/.
        - [ ] Once tested, send the package that was built in the previous steps to CRAN via this form: https://cran.r-project.org/submit.html.
        - [ ] Address CRAN feedback, tag the package vX.Y.Z-rc(n+1) and repeat the submission to CRAN whenever necessary.
        - [ ] Get the package accepted and published on CRAN.

        ### Tag the release

        - [ ] If the additional fields were removed, add them back in a separate PR, and then merge the PR back to main (add "[skip vbump]" in the PR title). If nothing was removed just merge the PR you created in the "Prepare the release" section to 'main'. Note the commit hash of the merged commit. **Note:** additional commits might be added to the `main` branch by a bot or an automation - we do **NOT** want to tag this commit.

        ### Make sure of the following before continuing

        - [ ] CI checks are passing in GH before releasing the package.
        - [ ] Shiny apps are deployable and there are no errors/warnings (Applicable only for frameworks that use Shiny).

        - [ ] Create a git tag with the final version set to vX.Y.Z on the main branch. In order to do this:
          1. Checkout the commit hash.
          `git checkout <commit hash>`
          2. Tag the hash with the release version (vX.Y.Z).
          `git tag vX.Y.Z`
          3. Push the tag to make the final release.
          `git push origin vX.Y.Z`
        - [ ] Update downstream package dependencies to (>=X.Y.Z) in {package name}.
        Note: Once the release tag is created, the package is automatically published to internal repositories.
