## rtables 0.6.11.9010

### New Features
 * Added `stat_string` to `as_result_df(make_ard = TRUE)` to preserve the original string representation of the statistics.
 * Added `add_tbl_name_split` to `as_result_df()` to handle split levels constituted by different table names.
 
### Bug Fixes
 * Fixed issue with `split_cols_by_multivar()` when having more than one value. Now `as_result_df(make_ard = TRUE)` adds a predefined split name for each of the `multivar` splits.
 * Fixed a bug with `tt_at_path()` caused by the impossibility to solve multiple branches with identical names. 
 * Fixed bug happening when format functions were changing the number of printed values. Now `as_result_df(make_ard = TRUE)` uses the cell values for `stat_strings` for these exceptions.
 * `section_div` argument to `analyze` no longer sometimes applies dividers between each generated row in some cases. by @gmbecker
 * Fixed bug in `[<-` causing information to be stripped from other cells if a new `rcell` is set within a table row.
 * Fixed a bug in `as_result_df(make_ard = TRUE)` when different columns had different amounts of `""` values.
 * Fixed bug in cases where `stat_name` is `character(0)` (`as_result_df(make_ard = TRUE)`).
 
### Miscellaneous
 * Added handler `add_tbl_str_decimals = TRUE` to `...` into `as_result_df(make_ard = TRUE)` to add `stat_string` column for the 
 `ARD` output.
 * As `stat_string` are more fragile than default `as_result_df(make_ard = TRUE)` calculation and are in theory optional, a warning is thrown when errors arise and the `stat_string` column is not added.

## rtables 0.6.11

### New Features
 * Initialized vignette about quality control outputs of `as_result_df()`.
 * Completed parameter `make_ard` output for single-line statistical outputs.
 * Added `stat_names` to `rcell()` to be used by `as_result_df(make_ard = TRUE)`.

### Miscellaneous
 * Split `docx` document generation to the new package [`rtables.officer`](https://github.com/insightsengineering/rtables.officer).
 * Refactored  `as_result_df()` parameters `as_strings` and `as_viewer` into `data_format = c("full_precision", "strings", "numeric")` following the same outputs.
 * Refactored `as_result_df()` to have a standard behavior, with all the relevant parameters, and a possibility to add personalized `spec`.
 * Removed `result_df_specs()`, because `as_result_df()` was a too shallow wrapper.
 * Merged behavior of  `as_result_df()` parameters `as_is` and `simplify` parameters to remove structural information.

### Bug Fixes
 * Fixed bug that was keeping indentation space characters in top left information when making a `flextable` from a `TableTree` object.
 * Fixed bug in `analyze` that was causing an error when passing a single `NA` value to the
`var_labels` parameter.
 * Fixed bugs for multiple `analyze` calls in `as_result_df`.

## rtables 0.6.10

### New Features

### Enhancements
 * Modified `reorder_split_levels()` to cover more edge cases and be more stringent in the allowed inputs.
 * Removed table tree `tt` input from `theme_docx_default()` and added code to handle row classes and number of columns internally.
 * Reworked padding and spacing in default theme `theme_docx_default()`.
 * Added parameter `bold_titles` to `tt_to_flextable()` to bold titles.

### Bug Fixes
 * Fixed `"\n"` newline issues in `as_html` by relying onto output devices for newline handling. Added `expand_newlines = FALSE` default to allow previous behavior.
 * `keep_split_levels()` throws now an error if the user requests to keep levels that are not present in data.
 * Fixed issue with removal of horizontal lines in `tt_as_flextable()` header when title was added.
 * Fixed multiple counts in header issue when exporting to `flextable`.
 * Fixed issue with empty cells `""` having larger imposed margins than filled cell. They are transformed into `" "` before rendering.
 * Fixed issue with borders appearing in `theme_docx_default()` when only one line of column names is present, but top left information is on multiple lines.

### Miscellaneous
 * Added option to change `sep = "\t"` and set other parameters via `...` parameter propagation in `export_as_tsv`.

## rtables 0.6.8
### New Features
 * Add support for `truetype` fonts based on `formatters` version `>= 0.5.8`. Nearly all functions related to pagination or export now accept `fontspec` argument and pass it around accordingly, by @gmbecker.
 * Core splitting machinery can now be overridden in column space via `make_split_fun` provided that `core_split` associates the generated facets with subsetting expressions. Subsetting expressions remain unnecessary for splits in row space. By @gmbecker.
 * ValueWrapper objects now carry around subsetting expressions for use during tabulation, by @gmbecker.
 * `make_split_res`, `add_to_split_result` now accept a list of subsetting expressions which will be attached to the values, by @gmbecker.

 * New (column-) path based `facet_colcount` getter and setter column count value at arbitrary point in column structure of built table @gmbecker.
 * New `facet_colcounts_visible` setter to conveniently set the column count visibility of a set of sibling facets in column space
 * New `rm_all_colcounts` convenience function for turning off visibility all column counts throughout the column structure @gmbecker.
 
### Bug Fixes
 * Fixed bug in `as_html` preventing indentation from being applied in `Viewer` output.
 * `col_counts<-` and `col_total<-` methods now explicitly convert `value` to integer, by @gmbecker.
 * `col_gap` is now respected in `nlines` row methods, and thus by `make_row_df`, by @gmbecker.

### Miscellaneous
 * Added `lifecycle` badge files for deprecated documentation.
 * Deprecated the `gap` and `check_headers` arguments to `rbindl_rtables` using `lifecycle`.

 * Fixed issue with `rtables_root` not being removed when using `as_result_df`.
 * Fixed edge case bug in `as_result_df` where rows of the table have only `"root"` as path index.
 * Fixed `sort_at_path` pathing to ignore leading `"root"` element (regardless of actual root element name) to match current `tt_at_path` behavior.
 * Fixed `section_div` for analysis of multiple variables (`AnalyzeMultiVars`).
 * Fixed mismatch between indentation declared in row info (`mf_rinfo(mf)`) and actual selected indentation from `matrix_form(mf, indent_rownames = FALSE)`.

   related `basic_table` parameter.
 * Added `na_str` argument to `analyze_colvars` to set custom string to print in place of missing values.

### Bug Fixes
 * Fixed a bug that was failing when wrapping and section dividers were used at the same time.

 * Whitespace is not trimmed when rendering tables with `as_html`.
 * Started deprecation cycle for `col_fnotes_here` to be replaced with `col_footnotes`.
 * Exported `section_div` methods now have a dedicated documentation page that is visible to users.
 * When tables are exported as `txt`, they preserve the horizontal separator of the table.
 * Added imports on `stringi` and `checkmate` as they are fundamental packages for string handling and
   argument checking.
 * Updated introduction vignette and split it into two. Section on introspecting tables is now located in a separate vignette.

 * Binding objects via `rbind` will retain titles/footer information if identical in all objects or only present in the first object being bound.

### Enhancements
 * Analysis functions (`cfun/afun`) have more information about current column split; `.spl_context` has access to `cur_col_id`, `cur_col_expr`, `cur_col_split`, and `cur_col_split_val`.
 * Added vignette on exploratory analysis with `qtable`.
 * Extracted `qtable_layout` from `qtable`.

### Bug Fixes
 * Page-by splits which generate zero facets (and thus tables which would have zero pages when rendered) now throw an informative error at table build time.
 * Removed superfluous warning which arose for custom split functions when reference group is is set (https://github.com/insightsengineering/rtables/issues/707#issuecomment-1678810598).
 * Fixed `qtable` labeling via `row_labels` ([#698](https://github.com/insightsengineering/rtables/issues/698)).

## rtables 0.3.7

Synchronize release with GitHub commit `sha`.

## rtables 0.3.6

Documentation revisions as requested by CRAN. No change to package code.

## rtables 0.3.5

Documentation-text only changes to introduction vignette to pass CRAN's URL checks. All package, example, test, and vignette code fully identical to that in tagged GitHub release 0.3.4

## rtables 0.3.4

Minor changes to the 0.3.3 version in order to submit `rtables` to CRAN.

## rtables 0.3.3

This version completely refactors the `rtables` package. We do provide a backwards compatibility layer with the
`rtable`, `rcell`, `rrow`, `rheader`, and `rtabulate` family of functions. However the table data structure and main
tabulation framework have changed. We provide extensive documentation in the manuals `help(package = "rtables")` and
vignettes `vignette(package = "rtables")` of the package.

The changes to `rtables` have been undertaken to better meet the requirements of creating and analyzing & reporting
tables in the context of clinical trials.


## rtables 0.3.2.17.9046

* `make_afun` now `force()`s all customization arguments immediately, which prevents problems when called within loop/`lapply` constructs.

## rtables 0.3.2.17.9045

* Tabulation machinery no longer removes NAs mandatorily in some cases, including `multivar` column splits
* `analyze_colvars`'s `inclNAs` argument now respected.

## rtables 0.3.2.17.9044

* Fix indent modifier propagation during tabulation
* Fix indent calculation in `make_pagdf`
* Add significant testing to ensure `make_pagdf` indent calculation remains correct

## rtables 0.3.2.17.9043

* Rework how reference columns are handled so analyses which use `.in_ref_col` and `.ref_group` work correctly when custom splitting is used (including the provided combination-levels mechanism)

## rtables 0.3.2.17.9042

* Fix naming/pathing for columns in `multivar` case (split itself now has default name `"multivars"`)
* Fix labeling bug when same variable appears multiple times in `MultiVarSplit` with different associated levels


## rtables 0.3.2.17.9041

* Allow single variable to be used within `split_cols_by_multivar`
* Various removal of defunct

## rtables 0.3.2.17.9040

* Fix regression caused by 0.3.2.17.9039 where column split values were displayed by name rather than label.

## rtables 0.3.2.17.9039

* Fix bug in display of column information when column structure is not symmetric, as with recursive `cbind`s.

## rtables 0.3.2.17.9036

* Fixed bug in row subsetting when table has only content rows.
* Basic compare_rtables function now works as in previous versions, no awareness of row or column structure.

## rtables 0.3.2.17.9036

* `summarize_row_groups` can now accept a list of functions for the `cfun` argument as `analyze_colvars` does.

## rtables 0.3.2.17.9035

* Fix bug unearthed by change in 0.3.2.17.9034 where cell formats not retained during column subsetting

## rtables 0.3.2.17.9034

* Fix internal `value_formats` accessor so it operates on `CellValue`s rather than the raw contained values (thus always returning NULL)
* `rrow` constructor no longer interprets cell formats a row format when they are the same across all cells. Fixes bug in  "correct way" code discussed in [#112](https://github.com/insightsengineering/rtables/issues/112)

## rtables 0.3.2.17.9033

* Interpret .formats in `in_rows` as *cell* formats rather than row formats.

## rtables 0.3.2.17.9031

* `cbind_rtables` can now take more than 2 tables.

## rtables 0.3.2.17.9029

* Fix issue underlying spurious length-mismatch warning in some cases when using `analyze_colvars`

## rtables 0.3.2.17.9028

* `analyze_colvars` now takes and adheres to `inclNAs` argument

## rtables 0.3.2.17.9027

* issues with no news:

## rtables 0.1.7

* added format `xx.xx (xx.xx - xx.xx)` and `x.xxxx | (<0.0001)`

## rtables 0.1.6

* Minor changes.

## rtables 0.1.5

* Changed testing approach to fit internal pipelines.

## rtables 0.1.4

* Replaced dots to underscore in class checking functions.

## rtables 0.1.3

* `col_by` in `rtabulate` now accepts matrices:
  - `col_by_to_matrix`, `col_by_to_factor`, `by_factor_to_matrix`.
  - `by_add_total`, `by_all`, `by_combine`, `by_quartile`, `by_compare_subset`,  `by_hierarchical`, `by_drop_empty_cols`.

* New utility functions to deal with variable labels:
  - `label`, `var_labels<-`, `var_labels`, `var_labels_remove`, `var_relabel`, `with_label`.

* Other new functions:
  - `cbing_rtables`.
  - `empty_rtables`, `is_empty_rtable`, `is_non_empty_rtable`, `is_rtable`.
  - `header_indent`, `header_indent<-`, `header_row.names`, `header_row.names<-`.
  - `insert_rrow`.

## rtables 0.1.2

* `rbind.rtable` now supports binding rtables with rows, e.g. `rbind(tbl1, rrow(), tbl2)` or `rbind(tbl1, rrow("row name"), tbl2)`.
* `rbindl_rtables` supports `NULL` objects in the list (except for the first element).
* Add `indent` function.
* `header_add_N` deals gracefully with `NULL` objects.

## rtables 0.1.1

* `rtablulate` family of functions do not support the `row_*_data_args` arguments anymore. Instead, the `col_wise_args` argument is introduced.
* Functions `order_rrows`, `sort_rrows`, `order_rtables`, and `sort_rtables` are introduced.
* Prevent `rtables` from being unlisted with `unlist.rtables`.


## rtables 0.1.0.6

* `Viewer` now also accepts objects of class `shiny.tag` (defined in package `htmltools`).
* `as.html` accepts `class.table`, `class.tr`, `class.th`, and `class.td` as an argument.

## rtables 0.1.0.5

* Added `sprintf_format` for formatting `rcell`s (thanks to Doug Kelkhoff for the suggestion).
* Added `"(N=xx)"` and `">999.9"` format labels.
* `rtabulate` has now an argument `col_N` and the function `col_N()`.

## rtables 0.1.0

* Version `0.1.0` is a major re-design with lots of internal refactoring and the following API changes:
  - Redesign: `rtable` has now `header` argument instead of `col.names`. A `header` can be created with `rheader` and is a collection of `rrow`s. If `header` is set to `c("A", "B")` then `rtable` will create the `rheader` with a single `rrow`  and by setting `row.name` to `NULL`.
  - `header` and `header<-` function added.
  - Renamed `get_rcell_formats` to `list_rcell_format_labels`.
  - If `rcell` format is `NULL` then the cell content will be converted to a string with `paste(as.character(x), collapse = ', ')`.
  - Accessor `[i,]` works now to subset a table.
  - `rbind` method for rtables.
  - `row.names<-.rtable` method.
  - `rtabulate` added for creating tables.
  - `indented_row.names` function added.

## rtables 0.0.1

* Initial public release
