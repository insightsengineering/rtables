## Reporting tables with R

The `rtables` R package was designed to create and display complex
tables with R. The cells in an `rtable` may contain any high-dimensional
data structure which can then be displayed with cell-specific formatting
instructions. Currently, `rtables` can be outputted in `ascii` `html`,
and `pdf`, as well Power Point (via conversion to `flextable` objects).
`rtf` support is in development and will be in a future release.

`rtables` is developed and copy written by `F. Hoffmann-La Roche` and it
is released open source under Apache License Version 2.

`rtables` development is driven by the need to create regulatory ready
tables for health authority review. Some of the key requirements for
this undertaking are listed below:

- cell values and their visualization separate (i.e.Â no string based
  tables)
  - values need to be programmatically accessible in their non-rounded
    state for cross-checking
- multiple values displayed within a cell
- flexible tabulation framework
- flexible formatting (cell spans, rounding, alignment, etc.)
- multiple output formats (html, ascii, latex, pdf, xml)
- flexible pagination in both horizontal and vertical directions
- distinguish between name and label in the data structure to work with
  `CDISC` standards
- title, footnotes, cell cell/row/column references

`rtables` currently covers virtually all of these requirements, and
further advances remain under active development.

## Installation

`rtables` is available on CRAN and you can install the latest released
version with:

``` r
install.packages("rtables")
```

or you can install the latest development version directly from GitHub
with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("insightsengineering/formatters")
remotes::install_github("insightsengineering/rtables")
```

Note you might need to set your `GITHUB_PAT` environment variable in
order to be able to install from GitHub.

Packaged releases (both those on CRAN and those between official CRAN
releases) can be found in the [releases
list](https://github.com/insightsengineering/rtables/releases).

## Usage

We first demonstrate with a demographic table-like example and then show
the creation of a more complex table.

``` r
library(rtables)

lyt <- basic_table() %>%
  split_cols_by("ARM") %>%
  analyze(c("AGE", "BMRKR1", "BMRKR2"), function(x, ...) {
    if (is.numeric(x)) {
      in_rows(
        "Mean (sd)" = c(mean(x), sd(x)),
        "Median" = median(x),
        "Min - Max" = range(x),
        .formats = c("xx.xx (xx.xx)", "xx.xx", "xx.xx - xx.xx")
      )
    } else if (is.factor(x) || is.character(x)) {
      in_rows(.list = list_wrap_x(table)(x))
    } else {
      stop("type not supported")
    }
  })
