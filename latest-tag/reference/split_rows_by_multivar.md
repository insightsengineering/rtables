# Associate multiple variables with rows

When we need rows to reflect different variables rather than different
levels of a single variable, we use `split_rows_by_multivar`.

## Usage

``` r
split_rows_by_multivar(
  lyt,
  vars,
  split_fun = NULL,
  split_label = "",
  varlabels = vars,
  parent_name = "multivars",
  format = NULL,
  na_str = NA_character_,
  nested = TRUE,
  child_labels = c("default", "visible", "hidden"),
  indent_mod = 0L,
  section_div = NA_character_,
  extra_args = list()
)
```

## Arguments

- lyt:

  (`PreDataTableLayouts`)  
  layout object pre-data used for tabulation.

- vars:

  (`character`)  
  vector of variable names.

- split_fun:

  (`function` or `NULL`)  
  custom splitting function. See
  [custom_split_funs](https://insightsengineering.github.io/rtables/reference/custom_split_funs.md).

- split_label:

  (`string`)  
  label to be associated with the table generated by the split. Not to
  be confused with labels assigned to each child (which are based on the
  data and type of split during tabulation).

- varlabels:

  (`character`)  
  vector of labels for `vars`.

- parent_name:

  (`character(1)`)  
  Name to assign to the table corresponding to the *split* or *group of
  sibling analyses*, for `split_rows_by*` and `analyze*` when analyzing
  more than one variable, respectively. Ignored when analyzing a single
  variable.

- format:

  (`string`, `function`, or `list`)  
  format associated with this split. Formats can be declared via strings
  (`"xx.x"`) or function. In cases such as `analyze` calls, they can be
  character vectors or lists of functions. See
  [`formatters::list_valid_format_labels()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/formatters/latest-tag/reference/list_formats.html)
  for a list of all available format strings.

- na_str:

  (`string`)  
  string that should be displayed when the value of `x` is missing.
  Defaults to `"NA"`.

- nested:

  (`logical`)  
  whether this layout instruction should be applied within the existing
  layout structure *if possible* (`TRUE`, the default) or as a new
  top-level element (`FALSE`). Ignored if it would nest a split
  underneath analyses, which is not allowed.

- child_labels:

  (`string`)  
  the display behavior for the labels (i.e. label rows) of the children
  of this split. Accepts `"default"`, `"visible"`, and `"hidden"`.
  Defaults to `"default"` which flags the label row as visible only if
  the child has 0 content rows.

- indent_mod:

  (`numeric`)  
  modifier for the default indent position for the structure created by
  this function (subtable, content table, or row) *and all of that
  structure's children*. Defaults to 0, which corresponds to the
  unmodified default behavior.

- section_div:

  (`string`)  
  string which should be repeated as a section divider after each group
  defined by this split instruction, or `NA_character_` (the default)
  for no section divider.

- extra_args:

  (`list`)  
  extra arguments to be passed to the tabulation function. Element
  position in the list corresponds to the children of this split. Named
  elements in the child-specific lists are ignored if they do not match
  a formal argument of the tabulation function.

## Value

A `PreDataTableLayouts` object suitable for passing to further layouting
functions, and to
[`build_table()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/rtables/reference/build_table.md).

## See also

[`split_rows_by()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/rtables/reference/split_rows_by.md)
for typical row splitting, and
[`split_cols_by_multivar()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/rtables/reference/split_cols_by_multivar.md)
to perform the same type of split on a column basis.

## Examples

``` r
lyt <- basic_table() %>%
  split_cols_by("ARM") %>%
  split_rows_by_multivar(c("SEX", "STRATA1")) %>%
  summarize_row_groups() %>%
  analyze(c("AGE", "SEX"))

tbl <- build_table(lyt, DM)
