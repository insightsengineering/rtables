# Sparse Notes on {rtables} Internals

This is a collection of notes divided by issues and it is a working
document that will end up being a developer vignette one day.

## `section_div` notes

Everything in the layout is built over split objects, that reside in
`00_tabletrees.R`. There `section_div` is defined internally in each
split object as `child_section_div` and assigned to `NA_character` as
default. This needs to be in all split objects that need to have a
separator divisor. Object-wise, the virtual class `Split` contains
`section_div` and it has the following sub-classes. I tagged with “X”
constructor that allows for `section_div` to be assigned to a value
different than `NA_character`, and `"NX"` otherwise.

This can be updated only by related layout functions. The most
important, that are covered by tests are `analyze` and `split_rows_by`.

Now it is relevant to understand where this information is saved in the
table object built by `build_table`. To do that we need to see where it
is present and how it is assigned. Let’s go back to `00tabletree.R`and
look for `trailing_section_div`. As classes definitions goes, you will
notice from the search that `trailing_section_div` is present in the
virtual classes `TableRow` and `VTableTree`. In the following is the
class hierarchy that makes \`trailing_section_div:

``` r
getClass("TableRow")

Always check the constructors after finding the classes. In the above
case for example, the `DataRow` and `ContentRow` share the constructor,
so we do not need to add identical getter and setters for these two
classes but only for the virtual class `TableRow`. Different is the
story for `LabelRow` which needs to be handle differently. Now, to
understand why only these two have this feature, lets see the structure
of a table built with section dividers:

``` r
lyt <- basic_table() %>%
  split_rows_by("ARM", section_div = "+") %>%
  split_rows_by("STRATA1", section_div = "") %>%
  analyze("AGE",
    afun = function(x) list("Mean" = mean(x), "Standard deviation" = sd(x)),
    format = list("Mean" = "xx.", "Standard deviation" = "xx."),
    section_div = "~"
  )

tbl <- build_table(lyt, DM)

print(tbl)
```

# methods("trailing_section_div") # to see this please do devtools::load_all()
# [1] trailing_section_div,LabelRow-method
# trailing_section_div,TableRow-method
# trailing_section_div,VTableTree-method
```

In the above, we show that `trailing_section_div` has methods for
`TableRow` virtual object, `LabelRow`, and `VTableTree`. These three
make the whole `section_div` structure as the `VTableTree` is present in
`TableTree` and `ElementaryTable` that are the two main table objects.
If these are not `NA_character_` then the `section_div` is printed at
split divisions. The `LabelRow` and `TableRow` are different as their
assignment allows the row-wise modification of separators. When we have
a special case for a `ContentRow`, as it is represented as
`content_table(obj)` which is a one-line `ElementaryTable`, while label
row is turned off. Please take a moment to check the following setter:

``` r
setMethod("section_div<-", "VTableTree", function(obj, value, only_sep_sections = FALSE) {
  char_v <- as.character(value)
  tree_depths <- unname(vapply(collect_leaves(obj), tt_level, numeric(1)))
  max_tree_depth <- max(tree_depths)
  stopifnot(is.logical(only_sep_sections))
  .check_char_vector_for_section_div(char_v, max_tree_depth, nrow(obj))

  # Automatic establishment of intent
  if (length(char_v) < nrow(obj)) {
    only_sep_sections <- TRUE
  }

  # Case where only separators or splits need to change externally
  if (only_sep_sections && length(char_v) < nrow(obj)) {
    if (length(char_v) == 1) {
      char_v <- rep(char_v, max_tree_depth - 1) # -1 is the data row
    }
    # Case where char_v is longer than the max depth
    char_v <- char_v[seq_len(min(max_tree_depth, length(char_v)))]
    # Filling up with NAs the rest of the tree depth section div chr vector
    missing_char_v_len <- max_tree_depth - length(char_v)
    char_v <- c(char_v, rep(NA_character_, missing_char_v_len))
    # char_v <- unlist(
    #   lapply(tree_depths, function(tree_depth_i) char_v[seq_len(tree_depth_i)]),
    #   use.names = FALSE
    # )
  }

  # Retrieving if it is a contentRow (no need for labelrow to be visible in this case)
  content_row_tbl <- content_table(obj)
  is_content_table <- isS4(content_row_tbl) && nrow(content_row_tbl) > 0

  # Main table structure change
  if (labelrow_visible(obj) || is_content_table) {
    if (only_sep_sections) {
      # Only tables are modified
      trailing_section_div(tt_labelrow(obj)) <- NA_character_
      trailing_section_div(obj) <- char_v[1]
      section_div(tree_children(obj), only_sep_sections = only_sep_sections) <- char_v[-1]
    } else {
      # All leaves are modified
      trailing_section_div(tt_labelrow(obj)) <- char_v[1]
      trailing_section_div(obj) <- NA_character_
      section_div(tree_children(obj), only_sep_sections = only_sep_sections) <- char_v[-1]
    }
  } else {
    section_div(tree_children(obj), only_sep_sections = only_sep_sections) <- char_v
  }
  obj
})
```

`only_sep_sections` is a parameter that is used to change only the
separators (between splits) and not the data rows. It is happening
forcefully if set to `TRUE`, but it is automatically activated when
`section_div(tbl) <- char_v` is a character vector of length
`< nrow(tbl)`. Notice that the exception for `ContentRow` is activated
by the switcher `is_content_table`. This is because content rows do not
have visible label row. You see that in the main table structure change
we have two blocks depending on `only_sep_sections`. If `TRUE` only the
`VTableTree` are modified leading to only split section separators to be
modified. Also consider looking at `section_div` getter and tests in
`test-accessors.R` to have more insights on the structure. Also to
understand exactly how this is bound to output, please check the result
of
[`make_row_df()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/formatters/latest-tag/reference/make_row_df.html)
for the column `trailing_sep`. Indeed, an alternative and iterative
method is used by `make_row_df` to retrieve the information about the
separators for each table row. Being it a trailing separator by
definition, we added `header_section_div` as a function and a parameter
of `basic_table`, so to possibly add an empty line after the header
(e.g. `header_section_div(tbl) = " "`). This is not a trailing
separator, but it is a separator that is added after the header. To
close the circle, please check how `trailing_sep` and
`header_section_div` is propagated and printed/used in
[`formatters::toString`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/formatters/latest-tag/reference/tostring.html).
