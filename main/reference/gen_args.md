```

## Arguments

- df:

  (`data.frame` or `tibble`)  
  dataset.

- alt_counts_df:

  (`data.frame` or `tibble`)  
  alternative full dataset the rtables framework will use *only* when
  calculating column counts.

- spl:

  (`Split`)  
  a `Split` object defining a partitioning or analysis/tabulation of the
  data.

- pos:

  (`numeric`)  
  which top-level set of nested splits should the new layout feature be
  added to. Defaults to the current split.

- tt:

  (`TableTree` or related class)  
  a `TableTree` object representing a populated table.

- tr:

  (`TableRow` or related class)  
  a `TableRow` object representing a single row within a populated
  table.

- verbose:

  (`flag`)  
  whether additional information should be displayed to the user.
  Defaults to `FALSE`.

- colwidths:

  (`numeric`)  
  a vector of column widths for use in vertical pagination.

- obj:

  (`ANY`)  
  the object for the accessor to access or modify.

- x:

  (`ANY`)  
  an object.

- value:

  (`ANY`)  
  the new value.

- object:

  (`ANY`)  
  the object to modify in place.

- path:

  (`character`)  
  a vector path for a position within the structure of a `TableTree`.
  Each element represents a subsequent choice amongst the children of
  the previous choice.

- label:

  (`string`)  
  a label (not to be confused with the name) for the object/structure.

- label_pos:

  (`string`)  
  location where the variable label should be displayed. Accepts
  `"hidden"` (default for non-analyze row splits), `"visible"`,
  `"topleft"`, and `"default"` (for analyze splits only). For `analyze`
  calls, `"default"` indicates that the variable should be visible if
  and only if multiple variables are analyzed at the same level of
  nesting.

- cvar:

  (`string`)  
  the variable, if any, that the content function should accept.
  Defaults to `NA`.

- topleft:

  (`character`)  
  override values for the "top left" material to be displayed during
  printing.

- page_prefix:

  (`string`)  
  prefix to be appended with the split value when forcing pagination
  between the children of a split/table.

- hsep:

  (`string`)  
  set of characters to be repeated as the separator between the header
  and body of the table when rendered as text. Defaults to a connected
  horizontal line (unicode 2014) in locals that use a UTF charset, and
  to `-` elsewhere (with a once per session warning). See
  [`formatters::set_default_hsep()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/formatters/latest-tag/reference/default_horizontal_sep.html)
  for further information.

- indent_size:

  (`numeric(1)`)  
  number of spaces to use per indent level. Defaults to 2.

- section_div:

  (`string`)  
  string which should be repeated as a section divider after each group
  defined by this split instruction, or `NA_character_` (the default)
  for no section divider.

- na_str:

  (`string`)  
  string that should be displayed when the value of `x` is missing.
  Defaults to `"NA"`.

- inset:

  (`numeric(1)`)  
  number of spaces to inset the table header, table body, referential
  footnotes, and main_footer, as compared to alignment of title,
  subtitle, and provenance footer. Defaults to 0 (no inset).

- table_inset:

  (`numeric(1)`)  
  number of spaces to inset the table header, table body, referential
  footnotes, and main footer, as compared to alignment of title,
  subtitles, and provenance footer. Defaults to 0 (no inset).

- tt_type:

  (`character(1)`)  
  One of "any", "row", "table", "elemtable"; when testing existence or
  resolving a path with "\*" wildcards, this indicates a restriction on
  *the final element the path resolves to*. E.g., for "table", possible
  paths which match the structure of the wild-card path but resolve to
  an individual row will not be considered matching. The value
  "elemtable" indicates an Elementary table, i.e., one representing a
  single variable within an `analyze` call.

- ...:

  additional parameters passed to methods or tabulation functions.

## Value

No return value.
