# Variable associated with a split

This function is intended for use when writing custom splitting logic.
In cases where the split is associated with a single variable, the name
of that variable will be returned. At time of writing this includes
splits generated via the
[`split_rows_by()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/rtables/reference/split_rows_by.md),
[`split_cols_by()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/rtables/reference/split_cols_by.md),
[`split_rows_by_cuts()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/rtables/reference/varcuts.md),
[`split_cols_by_cuts()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/rtables/reference/varcuts.md),
[`split_rows_by_cutfun()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/rtables/reference/varcuts.md),
and
[`split_cols_by_cutfun()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/rtables/reference/varcuts.md)
layout directives.

## Usage

spl_variable(spl)

# S4 method for class 'VarLevelSplit'

spl_variable(spl)

# S4 method for class 'VarStaticCutSplit'
spl_variable(spl)

# S4 method for class 'Split'
