# Add rows according to levels of a variable

Add rows according to levels of a variable

## Usage

``` r
split_rows_by(
  lyt,
  var,
  labels_var = var,
  split_label = var,
  split_fun = NULL,
  parent_name = var,
  format = NULL,
  na_str = NA_character_,
  nested = TRUE,
  child_labels = c("default", "visible", "hidden"),
  label_pos = "hidden",
  indent_mod = 0L,
  page_by = FALSE,
  page_prefix = split_label,
  section_div = NA_character_
)
```

## Arguments

- lyt:

  (`PreDataTableLayouts`)  
  layout object pre-data used for tabulation.

- var:

  (`string`)  
  variable name.

- labels_var:

  (`string`)  
  name of variable containing labels to be displayed for the values of
  `var`.

- split_label:

  (`string`)  
  label to be associated with the table generated by the split. Not to
  be confused with labels assigned to each child (which are based on the
  data and type of split during tabulation).

- split_fun:

  (`function` or `NULL`)  
  custom splitting function. See
  [custom_split_funs](https://insightsengineering.github.io/rtables/reference/custom_split_funs.md).

- parent_name:

  (`character(1)`)  
  Name to assign to the table corresponding to the *split* or *group of
  sibling analyses*, for `split_rows_by*` and `analyze*` when analyzing
  more than one variable, respectively. Ignored when analyzing a single
  variable.

- format:

  (`string`, `function`, or `list`)  
  format associated with this split. Formats can be declared via strings
  (`"xx.x"`) or function. In cases such as `analyze` calls, they can be
  character vectors or lists of functions. See
  [`formatters::list_valid_format_labels()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/formatters/latest-tag/reference/list_formats.html)
  for a list of all available format strings.

- na_str:

  (`string`)  
  string that should be displayed when the value of `x` is missing.
  Defaults to `"NA"`.

- nested:

  (`logical`)  
  whether this layout instruction should be applied within the existing
  layout structure *if possible* (`TRUE`, the default) or as a new
  top-level element (`FALSE`). Ignored if it would nest a split
  underneath analyses, which is not allowed.

- child_labels:

  (`string`)  
  the display behavior for the labels (i.e. label rows) of the children
  of this split. Accepts `"default"`, `"visible"`, and `"hidden"`.
  Defaults to `"default"` which flags the label row as visible only if
  the child has 0 content rows.

- label_pos:

  (`string`)  
  location where the variable label should be displayed. Accepts
  `"hidden"` (default for non-analyze row splits), `"visible"`,
  `"topleft"`, and `"default"` (for analyze splits only). For `analyze`
  calls, `"default"` indicates that the variable should be visible if
  and only if multiple variables are analyzed at the same level of
  nesting.

- indent_mod:

  (`numeric`)  
  modifier for the default indent position for the structure created by
  this function (subtable, content table, or row) *and all of that
  structure's children*. Defaults to 0, which corresponds to the
  unmodified default behavior.

- page_by:

  (`flag`)  
  whether pagination should be forced between different children
  resulting from this split. An error will occur if the selected split
  does not contain at least one value that is not `NA`.

- page_prefix:

  (`string`)  
  prefix to be appended with the split value when forcing pagination
  between the children of a split/table.

- section_div:

  (`string`)  
  string which should be repeated as a section divider after each group
  defined by this split instruction, or `NA_character_` (the default)
  for no section divider.

## Value

A `PreDataTableLayouts` object suitable for passing to further layouting
functions, and to
[`build_table()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/rtables/reference/build_table.md).

## Note

If `var` is a factor with empty unobserved levels and `labels_var` is
specified, it must also be a factor with the same number of levels as
`var`. Currently the error that occurs when this is not the case is not
very informative, but that will change in the future.

## Custom Splitting Function Details

User-defined custom split functions can perform any type of computation
on the incoming data provided that they meet the requirements for
generating "splits" of the incoming data based on the split object.

Split functions are functions that accept:

- df:

  a `data.frame` of incoming data to be split.

- spl:

  a Split object. This is largely an internal detail custom functions
  will not need to worry about, but `obj_name(spl)`, for example, will
  give the name of the split as it will appear in paths in the resulting
  table.

- vals:

  any pre-calculated values. If given non-`NULL` values, the values
  returned should match these. Should be `NULL` in most cases and can
  usually be ignored.

- labels:

  any pre-calculated value labels. Same as above for `values`.

- trim:

  if `TRUE`, resulting splits that are empty are removed.

- (optional) .spl_context:

  a `data.frame` describing previously performed splits which
  collectively arrived at `df`.

The function must then output a named `list` with the following
elements:

- values:

  the vector of all values corresponding to the splits of `df`.

- datasplit:

  a list of `data.frame`s representing the groupings of the actual
  observations from `df`.

- labels:

  a character vector giving a string label for each value listed in the
  `values` element above.

- (optional) extras:

  if present, extra arguments are to be passed to summary and analysis
  functions whenever they are executed on the corresponding element of
  `datasplit` or a subset thereof.

One way to generate custom splitting functions is to wrap existing split
functions and modify either the incoming data before they are called or
their outputs.
