Particularly noteworthy context fact actual table splitting occurs row-dominant way (even column splitting present layout). rtables provides user-end function table_structure() prints structure given table object. simple illustration, consider following example: table, 4 sub-tables SEX table. : F, M, U, UNDIFFERENTIATED. sub-tables one sub-table AGE. example, first AGE sub-table, parent table F. concept hierarchical, tree-like representations resulting tables translates directly format precedence inheritance rules. general principle, format finally applied cell one specific, , one closest cell given path tree. Hence, precedence-inheritance chain looks like following: chain, outermost parent_table least specific place specify format, cell specific one. cases format specified user one place, one specific applied cell. specific format selected user split, default format applied. default format \"xx\" yields formatting .character() function. following sections vignette, illustrate format precedence rules examples.","code":"lyt <- basic_table() %>%   split_cols_by(\"ARM\") %>%   split_rows_by(\"SEX\") %>%   analyze(vars = \"AGE\", afun = mean)  adsl_analyzed <- build_table(lyt, ADSL) adsl_analyzed #                       A: Drug X          B: Placebo       C: Combination  # ————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————— # F                                                                         #   mean             32.7594936708861   34.1168831168831   35.1969696969697 # M                                                                         #   mean             35.5686274509804   37.4363636363636   35.3833333333333 # U                                                                         #   mean             31.6666666666667          31               35.25       # UNDIFFERENTIATED                                                          #   mean                    28                 NA                 45 table_structure(adsl_analyzed) # [TableTree] SEX #  [TableTree] F #   [ElementaryTable] AGE (1 x 3) #  [TableTree] M #   [ElementaryTable] AGE (1 x 3) #  [TableTree] U #   [ElementaryTable] AGE (1 x 3) #  [TableTree] UNDIFFERENTIATED #   [ElementaryTable] AGE (1 x 3) parent_table -> parent_table -> ... -> parent_table -> cell"},{"path":"https://insightsengineering.github.io/rtables/articles/format_precedence.html","id":"standard-format","dir":"Articles","previous_headings":"Formats Precedence","what":"Standard Format","title":"Format Precedence and NA Handling","text":"simple layout explicitly set format output analysis function. case, default format applied.","code":"lyt0 <- basic_table() %>%   split_cols_by(\"ARM\") %>%   analyze(vars = \"AGE\", afun = mean)  build_table(lyt0, ADSL) #           A: Drug X          B: Placebo       C: Combination  # ————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————— # mean   33.7686567164179   35.4328358208955   35.4318181818182"},{"path":"https://insightsengineering.github.io/rtables/articles/format_precedence.html","id":"cell-format","dir":"Articles","previous_headings":"Formats Precedence","what":"Cell Format","title":"Format Precedence and NA Handling","text":"format cell can explicitly specified via rcell() in_rows() functions. former essentially collection data objects latter collection rcell() objects. previously mentioned, specific place format can specified user. format specified places time, one specified via in_rows() takes highest precedence.

Even meaning counts fixed, however, can mean number different things, depending (sub)population considering count percent . Different denominators used production can include overall relevant count : column (often trial arm) individual facet (row x column) row group (across columns) ancestor row facet (across columns) ancestor row facet single column Keeping mind might either two types counting discussed (generally events patients clinical trial setting). Furthermore, denominators can often need derived alt_counts_df used build table counting patients, rather data directly tabulated, due fact patients guaranteed appear event based datasets (e.g., ADAE). , can see denominators can vary wildly, cause percents displayed well. use custom afun (disp_denoms) explore differences types denominators. details implement disp_denoms function used germane discussion motivated readers can choose inspect . disp_denoms defined, can proceed using see varied options denominator calculating percent: table displays various denominators might use across types counting discussed previous section. denominator choices result least one difference calculated percent choices across full table (barring coincidental equality count types data). Thus programming table shell ubiquitous “xx (xx.x%)” family formats, must carefully choose afun calculates correct type percent. Many existing analysis functions provided production libraries tern junco support different denominator options use calculating percents box, though support full breadth variety explored .

Similarly, wrapper function col_paths() available, displays column structure: row_paths_summary() col_paths_summary() functions wrap respective make_*_df functions, printing name, node_class, path information (row case), label path information (column case), indented illustrate table structure:","code":"table_structure(tbl) # [TableTree] STRATA1 #  [TableTree] A [cont: 1 x 7] #   [ElementaryTable] AGE (1 x 7) #  [TableTree] B [cont: 1 x 7] #   [ElementaryTable] AGE (1 x 7) #  [TableTree] C [cont: 1 x 7] #   [ElementaryTable] AGE (1 x 7) table_structure(tbl, detail = \"row\") # or \"subtable\" # TableTree: [STRATA1] (STRATA1) #   labelrow: [STRATA1] (STRATA1) - <not visible> #   children:  #     TableTree: [A] (A) #       labelrow: [A] (A) - <not visible> #       content: #         ElementaryTable: [A@content] () #           labelrow: [] () - <not visible> #           children:  #             ContentRow: [A] (A) #       children:  #         ElementaryTable: [AGE] (AGE) #           labelrow: [AGE] (AGE) - <not visible> #           children:  #             DataRow: [max] (max) #     TableTree: [B] (B) #       labelrow: [B] (B) - <not visible> #       content: #         ElementaryTable: [B@content] () #           labelrow: [] () - <not visible> #           children:  #             ContentRow: [B] (B) #       children:  #         ElementaryTable: [AGE] (AGE) #           labelrow: [AGE] (AGE) - <not visible> #           children:  #             DataRow: [max] (max) #     TableTree: [C] (C) #       labelrow: [C] (C) - <not visible> #       content: #         ElementaryTable: [C@content] () #           labelrow: [] () - <not visible> #           children:  #             ContentRow: [C] (C) #       children:  #         ElementaryTable: [AGE] (AGE) #           labelrow: [AGE] (AGE) - <not visible> #           children:  #             DataRow: [max] (max) coltree_structure(tbl) # [root] (no pos) #    [ARMCD] (no pos) #      [ARM A] (ARMCD: ARM A) #        [S1] (ARMCD: ARM A -> STRATA2: S1) #        [S2] (ARMCD: ARM A -> STRATA2: S2) #      [ARM B] (ARMCD: ARM B) #        [S1] (ARMCD: ARM B -> STRATA2: S1) #        [S2] (ARMCD: ARM B -> STRATA2: S2) #      [ARM C] (ARMCD: ARM C) #        [S1] (ARMCD: ARM C -> STRATA2: S1) #        [S2] (ARMCD: ARM C -> STRATA2: S2) #    [All] (no pos) #      [All] (All: All) make_row_df(tbl)[, c(\"label\", \"name\", \"abs_rownumber\", \"path\", \"node_class\")] #   label name abs_rownumber         path node_class # 1     A    A             1 STRATA1,....
