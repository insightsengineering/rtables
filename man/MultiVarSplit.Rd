  varlbls = NULL,
  cfun = NULL,
  cfmt = NULL,
  splfmt = NULL,
  splname = paste(vars, collapse = ":"),

}
\arguments{
\item{vars}{character vector. Multiple variable names.}

\item{splbl}{string. Labe associated with this split}

\item{varlbls}{character vector. Labels for \code{vars}}

\item{cfmt}{format spec. Format for content rows}

\item{splfmt}{format spec. Format associated with this split.}

\item{splname}{string. Name associiated with this split (for pathing, etc)}

\item{lblkids}{logical. Should the children of this split have label rows. Defaults to \code{NA} which creates a label row only if the child has 0 content rows.}
