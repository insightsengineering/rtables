\arguments{
\item{lyt}{layout object pre-data used for tabulation}

\item{vars}{character vector. Multiple variable names.}

\item{afun}{function. Analysis function, must take \code{x} or \code{df} as
its first parameter. Can optionally take other parameters which will be
populated by the tabulation framework. See Details in
\code{\link{analyze}}.}

\item{var_labels}{character. Variable labels for 1 or more variables}

\item{table_names}{character. Names for the tables representing each atomic
analysis. Defaults to \code{var}.}

\item{format}{FormatSpec. Format associated with this split. Formats can be
declared via strings (\code{"xx.x"}) or function. In cases such as
\code{analyze} calls, they can character vectors or lists of functions.}

\item{nested}{boolean. Should this layout instruction be applied within the
existing layout structure \emph{if possible} (\code{TRUE}, the default) or as a
new top-level element (`FALSE). Ignored if it would nest a split underneath
analyses, which is not allowed.}

\item{inclNAs}{boolean. Should observations with NA in the \code{var}
variable(s) be included when performing this analysis. Defaults to
\code{FALSE}}

\item{extra_args}{list. Extra arguments to be passed to the tabulation
function. Element position in thte list corresponds to the children of this
split. Named elements in the child-specific lists are ignored if they do
not match a formal argument of the ttabulation function.}

\item{show_labels}{character(1). Should the variable labels for corresponding
to the variable(s) in \code{vars} be visible in the resulting table.}

\item{indent_mod}{numeric. Modifier for the default indent position for the
structure created by this function(subtable, content table, or row)
\emph{and all of that structure's children}. Defaults to 0, which
corresponds to the unmodified default behavior.}

\item{section_div}{character(1). String which should be repeated as a section
divider after each group defined by this split instruciton, or
\code{NA_character_} (the default) for no section divider.}
}
\value{
A \code{PreDataTableLayouts} object suitable for passing to further
layouting functions, and to \code{build_table}.
}
\description{
Adding /analyzed variables/ to our table layout defines the primary
tabulation to be performed. We do this by adding calls to \code{analyze}
and/or \code{\link{analyze_colvars}} into our layout pipeline. As with adding
further splitting, the tabulation will occur at the current/next level of
nesting by default.
}
\details{
When non-NULL \code{format} is used to specify formats for all generated
rows, and can be a character vector, a function, or a list of functions. It
will be repped out to the number of rows once this is known during the
tabulation process, but will be overridden by formats specified within
\code{rcell} calls in \code{afun}.

The analysis function (\code{afun}) should take as its first parameter either
\code{x} or \code{df}. Which of these the function accepts changes the
behavior when tabulation is performed.

\itemize{
\item{
If \code{afun}'s first parameter is x, it will receive the corresponding
subset \emph{vector} of data from the relevant column (from \code{var}
here) of the raw data being used to build the table.
}

\item{
If \code{afun}'s first parameter is \code{df}, it will receive the
corresponding subset \emph{data.frame} (i.e. all columns) of the raw data
being tabulated
}
}

In addition to differentiation on the first argument, the analysis function
can optionally accept a number of other parameters which, \emph{if and only
if} present in the formals will be passed to the function by the tabulation
machinery. These are as follows:

\describe{
\item{.N_col}{column-wise N (column count) for the full column being
tabulated within}
\item{.N_total}{overall N (all observation count, defined as sum of column
counts) for the tabulation}
\item{.N_row}{row-wise N (row group count) for the group of observations
being analyzed (ie with no column-based subsetting)}
\item{.df_row}{ data.frame for observations in the row group being analyzed
(ie with no column-based subsetting)}
\item{.var}{variable that is analyzed}
\item{.ref_group}{data.frame or vector of subset corresponding to the
\code{ref_group} column including subsetting defined by row-splitting.
Optional and only required/meaningful if a \code{ref_group} column has been
defined}
\item{.ref_full}{data.frame or vector of subset corresponding to the
\code{ref_group} column without subsetting defined by row-splitting. Optional
and only required/meaningful if a \code{ref_group} column has been defined}
\item{.in_ref_col}{boolean indicates if calculation is done for cells
within the reference column}
\item{.spl_context}{data.frame, each row gives information about a
previous/'ancestor' split state. see below}
}
}
\note{
None of the arguments described in the Details section
can be overridden via extra_args or when calling
\code{\link{make_afun}}. \code{.N_col} and \code{.N_total} can
be overridden via the \code{col_counts} argument to
\code{\link{build_table}}. Alternative values for the others
must be calculated within \code{afun} based on a combination
of extra arguments and the unmodified values provided by the
tabulation framework.
}
\section{.spl_context Details}{

The \code{.spl_context} \code{data.frame} gives information about the subsets of data
corresponding to the splits within-which the current \code{analyze} action is
nested. Taken together, these correspond to the path that the resulting (set
of) rows the analysis function is creating, although the information is in a
slightly different form. Each split (which correspond to groups of rows in
the resulting table) is represented via the following columns:
\describe{
\item{split}{The name of the split (often the variable being split in the
simple case)}
\item{value}{The string representation of the value at that split}
\item{full_parent_df}{a dataframe containing the full data (ie across all
columns) corresponding to the path defined by the combination of \code{split}
and \code{value} of this row \emph{and all rows above this row}}
\item{all_cols_n}{the number of observations  corresponding to this row
grouping (union of all columns)}
\item{\emph{(row-split and analyze contexts only)} <1 column for each
column in the table structure}{ These list columns (named the same as
\code{names(col_exprs(tab))}) contain logical vectors corresponding to
the subset of this row's \code{full_parent_df} corresponding to that column}
\item{cur_col_subset}{List column containing logical vectors indicating the
subset of that row's \code{full_parent_df} for the column currently being
created by the analysis function}
\item{cur_col_n}{integer column containing the observation counts for that
split}
}

\emph{note Within analysis functions that accept \code{.spl_context}, the
\code{all_cols_n} and \code{cur_col_n} columns of the dataframe will contain the 'true'
observation counts corresponding to the row-group and row-group x column
subsets of the data. These numbers will not, and currently cannot, reflect
alternate column observation counts provided by the \code{alt_counts_df},
\code{col_counts} or \code{col_total} arguments to \code{\link{build_table}}}
