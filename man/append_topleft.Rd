\alias{append_topleft}
\title{Append a description to the 'top-left' materials for the layout}
\usage{
append_topleft(lyt, newlines)
}
\arguments{
\item{lyt}{layout object pre-data used for tabulation}

\item{newlines}{character. The new line(s) to be added to the materials}
}
\value{
A \code{PreDataTableLayouts} object suitable for passing to further
layouting functions, and to \code{build_table}.
}
\description{
This function \emph{adds} \code{newlines} to the current
set of "top-left materials".
}
\details{
Adds \code{newlines} to the set of strings representing the 'top-left'
materials declared in the layout (the content displayed to the left of
the column labels when the resulting tables are printed).

Top-left material strings are stored and then displayed \emph{exactly as is},
no structure or indenting is applied to them either wheyn they are added
or when they are displayed.
}
\note{
Currently, where in the construction of the layout this is called
makes no difference, as it is indepenedent of the actual splitting keywords.
This may change in the future.

This function is experimental, its name and the details of
its behavior are subject to change in future versions.
