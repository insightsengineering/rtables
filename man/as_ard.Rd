Generate an Analysis Ready Dataset (ARD)

\details{
ARD specifications may differ in the exact information they include and
the form in which they represent it. Specifications whose names end in "_experimental"
are subject to change without notice, but specifications without the "_experimental"
suffix will remain available \emph{including any bugs in their construction} indefinitely.

This function may eventually be migrated to a separate package, and so should
