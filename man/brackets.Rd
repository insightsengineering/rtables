single cell was selected with \code{drop=TRUE}, in which case the (possibly
multi-valued) fully stripped raw value of the selected cell.
}
\details{
by default, subsetting drops the information about title, subtitle,
main footer, provenance footer, and \code{topleft}. If only a column is selected
and all rows are kept, the \code{topleft} information remains as default. Any
referential footnote is kept whenever the subset table contains the
referenced element.
}
\note{
subsetting always preserve the original order, even if provided
indexes do not preserve it. If sorting is needed, please consider
using \code{sort_at_path()}. Also note that \code{character} indices are treated as paths,
not vectors of names in both \code{[} and \verb{[<-}.
