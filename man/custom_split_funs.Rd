\title{Custom Split Functions}
\description{
Split functions provide the work-horse for \code{rtables}'s
generalized partitioning. These functions accept a (sub)set of incoming
data, a split object, and return 'splits' of that data.
}
\section{Custom Splitting Function Details}{


User-defined custom split functions can perform any type of computation on
the incoming data provided that they meet the contract for generating
'splits' of the incoming data 'based on' the split object.

Split functions are functions that accept:
\describe{
\item{df}{data.frame of incoming data to be split}
\item{spl}{a Split object. this is largely an internal detail custom
functions will not need to worry about, but  \code{obj_name(spl)}, for
example, will give the name of the split as it will appear in paths in the
resulting table}
\item{vals}{Any pre-calculated values. If given non-null values, the values
returned should match these. Should be NULL in most cases and can likely be
ignored}
\item{labels}{Any pre-calculated value labels. Same as above for
\code{values}}
\item{trim}{If \code{TRUE}, resulting splits that are empty should be
removed}
\item{(Optional) .spl_context}{a data.frame describing previously performed
splits which collectively arrived at \code{df}}
}

The function must then output a \code{named list} with the following
elements:

\describe{
\item{values}{The vector of all values corresponding to the splits of
\code{df}}
\item{datasplit}{a list of data.frames representing the groupings of the
actual observations from \code{df}.}
\item{labels}{a character vector giving a string label for each value listed
in the \code{values} element above}
\item{(Optional) extras}{If present, extra arguments are to be passed to summary
and analysis functions whenever they are executed on the corresponding
element of \code{datasplit} or a subset thereof}
}

One way to generate custom splitting functions is to wrap existing split
functions and modify either the incoming data before they are called or
their outputs.

\examples{
# Example of a picky split function. The number of values in the column variable
# var decrees if we are going to print also the column with all observation
# or not.

picky_splitter <- function(var) {
  # Main layout function
  function(df, spl, vals, labels, trim) {
    orig_vals <- vals

    # Check for number of levels if all are selected
    if (is.null(vals)) {
      vec <- df[[var]]
      vals <- unique(vec)
    }

    # Do a split with or without All obs
    if (length(vals) == 1) {
      do_base_split(spl = spl, df = df, vals = vals, labels = labels, trim = trim)
    } else {
      fnc_tmp <- add_overall_level("Overall", label = "All Obs", first = FALSE)
      fnc_tmp(df = df, spl = spl, vals = orig_vals, trim = trim)
    }
  }
}

# Data sub-set
d1 <- subset(ex_adsl, ARM == "A: Drug X" | (ARM == "B: Placebo" & SEX == "F"))
d1 <- subset(d1, SEX \%in\% c("M", "F"))
d1$SEX <- factor(d1$SEX)

# This table uses the number of values in the SEX column to add the overall col or not
lyt <- basic_table() \%>\%
  split_cols_by("ARM", split_fun = drop_split_levels) \%>\%
  split_cols_by("SEX", split_fun = picky_splitter("SEX")) \%>\%
  analyze("AGE", show_labels = "visible")
tbl <- build_table(lyt, d1)
