\title{Label at Path}
\usage{
label_at_path(tt, path)

label_at_path(tt, path) <- value
}
\arguments{
\item{tt}{\code{TableTree} (or related class). A \code{TableTree} object representing a
populated table.}

\item{path}{character. A vector path for a position within the structure of a
\code{tabletree}. Each element represents a subsequent choice amongst the children
of the previous choice.}

\item{value}{The new value}
}
\description{
Gets or sets the label at a path
}
\details{
If \code{path} resolves to a single row, the label for that row
is retrieved or set. If, instead, \code{path} resolves to a subtable,
the text for the row-label associated with that path is retrieved
or set. In the subtable case, if the label text is set to a non-NA
value, the \code{labelrow} will be set to visible, even if it was not before.
Similarly, if the label row text for a subtable is set to NA,
the label row will bet set to non-visible, so the row will not
appear at all when the table is printed.
}
\note{
When changing the row labels for content rows, it is important to
path all the way to the \emph{row}. Paths ending in \code{"@content"} will
not exhibit the behavior you want, and are thus an error. See
\code{\link{row_paths}} for help determining the full paths to content
rows.
