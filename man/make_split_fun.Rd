\title{Create a Custom Splitting Function}
\usage{
make_split_fun(pre = list(), core_split = NULL, post = list())
}
\arguments{
\item{pre}{list. Zero or more functions which operate on the incoming data and return a new data frame that should split via \code{core_split}. They will be called on the data in the order they appear in the list}

\item{core_split}{function or NULL. If not NULL, a function which accepts the same arguments do_base_split does, and returns the same type of named list. Custom functions which override this behavior cannot be used in column splits.}

\item{post}{list. Zero or more functions which should be called on the list output by splitting}
}
\value{
A function for use as a custom split function
}
\description{
Create a Custom Splitting Function
}
\details{
Custom split functions can be thought of as (up to) 3 different types of manipulations of
the splitting process
\enumerate{
\item Preprocessing of the incoming data to be split
\item (Row-splitting only) Customization of the core mapping of incoming data to facets, and
\item Postprocessing operations on the set of facets (groups) generated by the split.
}

This function provides an interface to create custom split functions by implementing
and specifying sets of operations in each of those classes of customization independently.

Preprocessing  functions (1),  must  accept:  \code{df}, \code{spl},  \code{vals},
\code{labels},  and  can  optionally accept  \code{.spl_context}.  They  then
manipulate  \code{df} (the  incoming data  for the  split) and  return a
modified data.frame.  This modified  data.frame \emph{must}  contain all
columns present in the incoming  data.frame, but can add columns if
necessary (though we note that these  new columns cannot be used in
the layout as split or analysis variables, because they will not be
present when validity checking is done).

The preprocessing component is useful for things such as manipulating factor
levels, e.g., to trim unobserved ones or to reorder levels based on observed counts,
etc.

Customization of core splitting (2) is  currently only supported in row
splits. Core  splitting  functions  override  the  fundamental
splitting procedure,  and are only  necessary in rare  cases. These
must  accept  \code{spl}, \code{df},  \code{vals},  \code{labels},  and can  optionally
accept \code{.spl_context}. They must return a named list with elements,
all of  the same  length, as follows:  - \code{datasplit}  (containing a
list of data.frames), -  \code{values} containing values associated with
the   facets,   which   must   be   \code{character}   or   \code{SplitValue}
objects. These  values will  appear in the  paths of  the resulting
table.  - \code{labels} containing  the character labels associated with
\code{values}

Postprocessing functions (3) must  accept the result of  the core split
as their first  argument (which as of writing can  be anything), in
addition  to  \code{spl},  and   \code{fulldf},  and  can  optionally  accept
\code{.spl_context}. They must each return a modified version
of the same structure specified above for core splitting.

In both the pre- and  post-processing cases, multiple functions can
be specified. When this happens,  they are applied sequentially, in
the order they  appear in the list passed to  the relevant argument
(\code{pre} and \code{post}, respectively).
