\title{Sort substructure of a TableTree at a particular Path in the Tree.}
\usage{
sort_at_path(
  tt,
  path,
  scorefun,
  decreasing = NA,
  na.pos = c("omit", "last", "first"),
  .prev_path = character()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{tt}{TableTree (or related class). A TableTree object representing a
populated table.}

\item{path}{character. A vector path for a position within the structure of a
tabletree. Each element represents a subsequent choice amongst the children
of the previous choice.}

\item{scorefun}{function. Scoring function, should accept the type of
children directly under the position at \code{path} (either VTableTree,
VTableRow, or VTableNodeInfo, which covers both) and return a numeric value
to be sorted.}

\item{decreasing}{logical(1). Should the the scores generated by
\code{scorefun} be sorted in decreasing order. If unset (the default of
\code{NA}), it is set to \code{TRUE} if the generated scores are numeric
and \code{FALSE} if they are characters.}

\item{na.pos}{character(1). What should be done with children (subtrees/rows)
with \code{NA} scores. Defaults to \code{"omit"}, which removes them, other
allowed values are \code{"last"}  and \code{"first"} which indicate where
they should be placed in the order.}

\item{.prev_path}{character. Internal detail, do not set manually.}
}
\value{
A TableTree with the same structure as \code{tt} with the exception
that the requested sorting has been done at \code{path}
}
\description{
Sort substructure of a TableTree at a particular Path in the Tree.
}
\details{
The \code{path} here can include \code{"*"} as a step, which means
that each child at that step will be \emph{separately} sorted based on
\code{scorefun} and the remaining \code{path} entries. This can occur
multiple times in a path.
