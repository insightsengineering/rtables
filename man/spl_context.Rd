\description{
.spl_context within analysis and split functions
}
\section{.spl_context Details}{

The \code{.spl_context} \code{data.frame} gives information about the subsets of data
corresponding to the splits within-which the current \code{analyze} action is
nested. Taken together, these correspond to the path that the resulting (set
of) rows the analysis function is creating, although the information is in a
slightly different form. Each split (which correspond to groups of rows in
the resulting table), as well as the initial 'root' "split", is represented
via the following columns:
\describe{
\item{split}{The name of the split (often the variable being split in the
simple case)}
\item{value}{The string representation of the value at that split}
\item{full_parent_df}{a dataframe containing the full data (i.e. across all
columns) corresponding to the path defined by the combination of \code{split}
and \code{value} of this row \emph{and all rows above this row}}
\item{all_cols_n}{the number of observations  corresponding to this row
grouping (union of all columns)}
\item{\emph{(row-split and analyze contexts only)} <1 column for each
column in the table structure}{ These list columns (named the same as
\code{names(col_exprs(tab))}) contain logical vectors corresponding to
the subset of this row's \code{full_parent_df} corresponding to that column}
\item{cur_col_subset}{List column containing logical vectors indicating the
subset of that row's \code{full_parent_df} for the column currently being
created by the analysis function}
\item{cur_col_n}{integer column containing the observation counts for that
split}
}

\emph{note Within analysis functions that accept \code{.spl_context}, the
\code{all_cols_n} and \code{cur_col_n} columns of the dataframe will contain the 'true'
observation counts corresponding to the row-group and row-group x column
subsets of the data. These numbers will not, and currently cannot, reflect
alternate column observation counts provided by the \code{alt_counts_df},
\code{col_counts} or \code{col_total} arguments to \code{\link{build_table}}}
}
