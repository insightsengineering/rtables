\title{Trim Levels to map}
\usage{
trim_levels_to_map(map = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{map}{data.frame. A data.frame defining allowed combinations of
variables. Any combination at the level of this split not present in the
map will be removed from the data, both for the variable being split and
those present in the data but not associated with this split or any parents
of it.}
}
\value{
a fun
}
\description{
This split function constructor creatse a split function which trims
levels of a variable to reflect restrictions on the possible
combinations of two or more variables which are split by
(along the same axis) within a layout.
}
\details{
When splitting occurs, the map is subset to the values of all
previously performed splits. The levels of the variable being split are
then pruned to only those still present within this subset of the map
representing the current hierarchical splitting context.

Splitting is then performed via the \code{\link{keep_split_levels}} split
function.

Each resulting element of the partition is then further trimmed by pruning
values of any remaining variables specified in the map to those values
allowed under the combination of the previous and current split.

 map <- data.frame(
       LBCAT = c("CHEMISTRY", "CHEMISTRY", "CHEMISTRY", "IMMUNOLOGY"),
