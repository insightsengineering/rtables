# Reporting an Issue with rtables

Do not use this form to ask a question, or ask for assistance. Instead,
ask on [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) using the
`nest-rtables` tag. Questions about a function’s use will be closed
without a response.

Please briefly describe your problem and, when relevant, the output you
expect. Please also provide the output of
[`utils::sessionInfo()`](https://rdrr.io/r/utils/sessionInfo.html) or
[`devtools::session_info()`](https://sessioninfo.r-lib.org/reference/session_info.html)
at the end of your post.

If at all possible, please include a [minimal, reproducible
example](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963269/how-to-make-a-great-r-reproducible-example).
The `rtables` team will be much more likely to resolve your issue if
they are able to reproduce it themselves locally.

Please delete this preamble after you have read it.
