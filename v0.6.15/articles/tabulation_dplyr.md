# Comparison with dplyr Tabulation

## Introduction

In this vignette, we would like to discuss the similarities and
differences between `dplyr` and `rtable`.

Much of the `rtables` framework focuses on tabulation/summarizing of
data and then the visualization of the table. In this vignette, we focus
on summarizing data using `dplyr` and contrast it to `rtables`. We won’t
pay attention to the table visualization/markup and just derive the cell
content.

Using `dplyr` to summarize data and `gt` to visualize the table is a
good way if the tabulation is of a certain nature or complexity.
However, there are tables such as the table created in the
[`introduction`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/rtables/latest-release/articles/rtables.html)
vignette that take some effort to create with `dplyr`. Part of the
effort is due to fact that when using `dplyr` the table data is stored
in `data.frame`s or `tibble`s which is not the most natural way to
represent a table as we will show in this vignette.

If you know a more elegant way of deriving the table content with
`dplyr` please let us know and we will update the vignette.

``` r
library(rtables)
library(dplyr)
```

Here is the table and data used in the
[`introduction`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/rtables/latest-release/articles/rtables.html)
vignette:

``` r
n <- 400

set.seed(1)

df <- tibble(
  arm = factor(sample(c("Arm A", "Arm B"), n, replace = TRUE), levels = c("Arm A", "Arm B")),
  country = factor(sample(c("CAN", "USA"), n, replace = TRUE, prob = c(.55, .45)), levels = c("CAN", "USA")),
  gender = factor(sample(c("Female", "Male"), n, replace = TRUE), levels = c("Female", "Male")),
  handed = factor(sample(c("Left", "Right"), n, prob = c(.6, .4), replace = TRUE), levels = c("Left", "Right")),
  age = rchisq(n, 30) + 10
) %>% mutate(
  weight = 35 * rnorm(n, sd = .5) + ifelse(gender == "Female", 140, 180)
)

lyt <- basic_table(show_colcounts = TRUE) %>%
  split_cols_by("arm") %>%
  split_cols_by("gender") %>%
  split_rows_by("country") %>%
  summarize_row_groups() %>%
  split_rows_by("handed") %>%
  summarize_row_groups() %>%
  analyze("age", afun = mean, format = "xx.x")

tbl <- build_table(lyt, df)
tbl
#                     Arm A                     Arm B         
#              Female        Male        Female        Male   
#              (N=96)      (N=105)       (N=92)      (N=107)  
# ————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
# CAN        45 (46.9%)   64 (61.0%)   46 (50.0%)   62 (57.9%)
#   Left     32 (33.3%)   42 (40.0%)   26 (28.3%)   37 (34.6%)
#     mean      38.9         40.4         40.3         37.7   
#   Right    13 (13.5%)   22 (21.0%)   20 (21.7%)   25 (23.4%)
#     mean      36.6         40.2         40.2         40.6   
# USA        51 (53.1%)   41 (39.0%)   46 (50.0%)   45 (42.1%)
#   Left     34 (35.4%)   19 (18.1%)   25 (27.2%)   25 (23.4%)
#     mean      40.4         39.7         39.2         40.1   
#   Right    17 (17.7%)   22 (21.0%)   21 (22.8%)   20 (18.7%)
#     mean      36.9         39.8         38.5         39.0
```

## Getting Started

We will start by deriving the first data cell on row 3 (note, row 1 and
2 have content cells, see the
[`introduction`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/rtables/latest-release/articles/rtables.html)
vignette). Cell 3,1 contains the mean age for left handed & female
Canadians in “Arm A”:

``` r
mean(df$age[df$country == "CAN" & df$arm == "Arm A" & df$gender == "Female" & df$handed == "Left"])
# [1] 38.86979
```

or with `dplyr`:

``` r
df %>%
  filter(country == "CAN", arm == "Arm A", gender == "Female", handed == "Left") %>%
  summarise(mean_age = mean(age))
# # A tibble: 1 × 1
#   mean_age
#      <dbl>
# 1     38.9
```

Further, `dplyr` gives us other verbs to easily get the average age of
left handed Canadians for each group defined by the 4 columns:

``` r
df %>%
  group_by(arm, gender) %>%
  filter(country == "CAN", handed == "Left") %>%
  summarise(mean_age = mean(age))
# `summarise()` has grouped output by 'arm'. You can override using the `.groups`
# argument.
# # A tibble: 4 × 3
# # Groups:   arm [2]
#   arm   gender mean_age
#   <fct> <fct>     <dbl>
# 1 Arm A Female     38.9
# 2 Arm A Male       40.4
# 3 Arm B Female     40.3
# 4 Arm B Male       37.7
```

We can further get to all the average age cell values with:

``` r
average_age <- df %>%
  group_by(arm, gender, country, handed) %>%
  summarise(mean_age = mean(age))
# `summarise()` has grouped output by 'arm', 'gender', 'country'. You can
# override using the `.groups` argument.

average_age
# # A tibble: 16 × 5
# # Groups:   arm, gender, country [8]
#    arm   gender country handed mean_age
#    <fct> <fct>  <fct>   <fct>     <dbl>
#  1 Arm A Female CAN     Left       38.9
#  2 Arm A Female CAN     Right      36.6
#  3 Arm A Female USA     Left       40.4
#  4 Arm A Female USA     Right      36.9
#  5 Arm A Male   CAN     Left       40.4
#  6 Arm A Male   CAN     Right      40.2
#  7 Arm A Male   USA     Left       39.7
#  8 Arm A Male   USA     Right      39.8
#  9 Arm B Female CAN     Left       40.3
# 10 Arm B Female CAN     Right      40.2
# 11 Arm B Female USA     Left       39.2
# 12 Arm B Female USA     Right      38.5
# 13 Arm B Male   CAN     Left       37.7
# 14 Arm B Male   CAN     Right      40.6
# 15 Arm B Male   USA     Left       40.1
# 16 Arm B Male   USA     Right      39.0
```

In `rtable` syntax, we need the following code to get to the same
content:

``` r
lyt <- basic_table() %>%
  split_cols_by("arm") %>%
  split_cols_by("gender") %>%
  split_rows_by("country") %>%
  split_rows_by("handed") %>%
  analyze("age", afun = mean, format = "xx.x")

tbl <- build_table(lyt, df)
tbl
#                Arm A           Arm B    
#            Female   Male   Female   Male
# ————————————————————————————————————————
# CAN                                     
#   Left                                  
#     mean    38.9    40.4    40.3    37.7
#   Right                                 
#     mean    36.6    40.2    40.2    40.6
# USA                                     
#   Left                                  
#     mean    40.4    39.7    39.2    40.1
#   Right                                 
#     mean    36.9    39.8    38.5    39.0
```

As mentioned in the introduction to this vignette, please ignore the
difference in arranging and formatting the data: it’s possible to
condense the `rtable` more and it is possible to make the `tibble` look
more like the reference table using the `gt` R package.

In terms of tabulation for this example there was arguably not much
added by `rtables` over `dplyr`.

## Content Information

Unlike in `rtables` the different levels of summarization are discrete
computations in `dplyr` which we will then need to combine

We first focus on the count and percentage information for handedness
within each country (for each arm-gender pair), along with the analysis
row mean values:

``` r
c_h_df <- df %>%
  group_by(arm, gender, country, handed) %>%
  summarize(mean = mean(age), c_h_count = n()) %>%
  ## we need the sum below to *not* be by country, so that we're dividing by the column counts
  ungroup(country) %>%
  # now the `handed` grouping has been removed, therefore we can calculate percent now:
  mutate(n_col = sum(c_h_count), c_h_percent = c_h_count / n_col)
# `summarise()` has grouped output by 'arm', 'gender', 'country'. You can
# override using the `.groups` argument.
c_h_df
# # A tibble: 16 × 8
# # Groups:   arm, gender [4]
#    arm   gender country handed  mean c_h_count n_col c_h_percent
#    <fct> <fct>  <fct>   <fct>  <dbl>     <int> <int>       <dbl>
#  1 Arm A Female CAN     Left    38.9        32    96       0.333
#  2 Arm A Female CAN     Right   36.6        13    96       0.135
#  3 Arm A Female USA     Left    40.4        34    96       0.354
#  4 Arm A Female USA     Right   36.9        17    96       0.177
#  5 Arm A Male   CAN     Left    40.4        42   105       0.4  
#  6 Arm A Male   CAN     Right   40.2        22   105       0.210
#  7 Arm A Male   USA     Left    39.7        19   105       0.181
#  8 Arm A Male   USA     Right   39.8        22   105       0.210
#  9 Arm B Female CAN     Left    40.3        26    92       0.283
# 10 Arm B Female CAN     Right   40.2        20    92       0.217
# 11 Arm B Female USA     Left    39.2        25    92       0.272
# 12 Arm B Female USA     Right   38.5        21    92       0.228
# 13 Arm B Male   CAN     Left    37.7        37   107       0.346
# 14 Arm B Male   CAN     Right   40.6        25   107       0.234
# 15 Arm B Male   USA     Left    40.1        25   107       0.234
# 16 Arm B Male   USA     Right   39.0        20   107       0.187
```

which has 16 rows (cells) like the `average_age` data frame defined
above. Next, we will derive the group information for countries:

``` r
c_df <- df %>%
  group_by(arm, gender, country) %>%
  summarize(c_count = n()) %>%
  # now the `handed` grouping has been removed, therefore we can calculate percent now:
  mutate(n_col = sum(c_count), c_percent = c_count / n_col)
# `summarise()` has grouped output by 'arm', 'gender'. You can override using the
# `.groups` argument.
c_df
# # A tibble: 8 × 6
# # Groups:   arm, gender [4]
#   arm   gender country c_count n_col c_percent
#   <fct> <fct>  <fct>     <int> <int>     <dbl>
# 1 Arm A Female CAN          45    96     0.469
# 2 Arm A Female USA          51    96     0.531
# 3 Arm A Male   CAN          64   105     0.610
# 4 Arm A Male   USA          41   105     0.390
# 5 Arm B Female CAN          46    92     0.5  
# 6 Arm B Female USA          46    92     0.5  
# 7 Arm B Male   CAN          62   107     0.579
# 8 Arm B Male   USA          45   107     0.421
```

Finally, we
[`left_join()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate-joins.html)
the two levels of summary to get a data.frame containing the full set of
values which make up the body of our table (note, however, they are not
in the same order):

``` r
full_dplyr <- left_join(c_h_df, c_df) %>% ungroup()
# Joining with `by = join_by(arm, gender, country, n_col)`
```

Alternatively, we could calculate only the counts in `c_h_df`, and use
[`mutate()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate.html) after
the
[`left_join()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate-joins.html)
to divide the counts by the `n_col` values which are more naturally
calculated within `c_df`. This would simplify `c_h_df`’s creation
somewhat by not requiring the explicit
[`ungroup()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/group_by.html), but
it prevents each level of summarization from being a self-contained set
of computations.

The `rtables` call in contrast is:

``` r
lyt <- basic_table(show_colcounts = TRUE) %>%
  split_cols_by("arm") %>%
  split_cols_by("gender") %>%
  split_rows_by("country") %>%
  summarize_row_groups() %>%
  split_rows_by("handed") %>%
  summarize_row_groups() %>%
  analyze("age", afun = mean, format = "xx.x")

tbl <- build_table(lyt, df)
tbl
#                     Arm A                     Arm B         
#              Female        Male        Female        Male   
#              (N=96)      (N=105)       (N=92)      (N=107)  
# ————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
# CAN        45 (46.9%)   64 (61.0%)   46 (50.0%)   62 (57.9%)
#   Left     32 (33.3%)   42 (40.0%)   26 (28.3%)   37 (34.6%)
#     mean      38.9         40.4         40.3         37.7   
#   Right    13 (13.5%)   22 (21.0%)   20 (21.7%)   25 (23.4%)
#     mean      36.6         40.2         40.2         40.6   
# USA        51 (53.1%)   41 (39.0%)   46 (50.0%)   45 (42.1%)
#   Left     34 (35.4%)   19 (18.1%)   25 (27.2%)   25 (23.4%)
#     mean      40.4         39.7         39.2         40.1   
#   Right    17 (17.7%)   22 (21.0%)   21 (22.8%)   20 (18.7%)
#     mean      36.9         39.8         38.5         39.0
```

We can now spot check that the values are the same

``` r
frm_rtables_h <- cell_values(
  tbl,
  rowpath = c("country", "CAN", "handed", "Right", "@content"),
  colpath = c("arm", "Arm B", "gender", "Female")
)[[1]]
frm_rtables_h
# [1] 20.0000000  0.2173913

frm_dplyr_h <- full_dplyr %>%
  filter(country == "CAN" & handed == "Right" & arm == "Arm B" & gender == "Female") %>%
  select(c_h_count, c_h_percent)

frm_dplyr_h
# # A tibble: 1 × 2
#   c_h_count c_h_percent
#       <int>       <dbl>
# 1        20       0.217


frm_rtables_c <- cell_values(
  tbl,
  rowpath = c("country", "CAN", "@content"),
  colpath = c("arm", "Arm A", "gender", "Male")
)[[1]]

frm_rtables_c
# [1] 64.0000000  0.6095238

frm_dplyr_c <- full_dplyr %>%
  filter(country == "CAN" & arm == "Arm A" & gender == "Male") %>%
  select(c_count, c_percent)

frm_dplyr_c
# # A tibble: 2 × 2
#   c_count c_percent
#     <int>     <dbl>
# 1      64     0.610
# 2      64     0.610
```

Further, the `rtable` syntax has hopefully also become a bit more
straightforward to derive the cell values than with `dplyr` for this
particular table.

## Summary

In this vignette learned that:

- many tables are quite easily created with `dplyr` and `data.frame` or
  `tibble` as data structure
  - `dplyr` keeps simple things simple
- if tables have group summaries then repeating of information is
  required
- `rtables` streamlines the construction of complex tables

We recommend that you continue reading the
[`clinical_trials`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/rtables/latest-tag/articles/clinical_trials.html)
vignette where we create a number of more advanced tables using layouts.
