## `section_div` notes

Everything in the layout is built over split objects, that reside in `00_tabletrees.R`. There `section_div` is defined internally in each split object as `child_section_div` and assigned to `NA_character` as default. This needs to be in all split objects that need to have a separator divisor. Object-wise, the virtual class `Split` contains `section_div` and it has the following sub-classes. I tagged with "X" constructor that allows for `section_div` to be assigned to a value different than `NA_character`, and `"NX"` otherwise.

```{r}
library(rtables)
getClass("Split")
# Known Subclasses:
# ? Class "CustomizableSplit", directly # vclass used for grouping different split types (I guess)
# Class "AllSplit", directly            # NX
# Class "VarStaticCutSplit", directly   # X via make_static_cut_split
# Class "VarDynCutSplit", directly      # X
# Class "VAnalyzeSplit", directly       # X
# ? Class "CompoundSplit", directly   # Used only for AnalyzeMultiVars (maybe not needed?)
# Class "VarLevelSplit", by class "CustomizableSplit", distance 2            # X
# Class "MultiVarSplit", by class "CustomizableSplit", distance 2            # X
# Class "RootSplit", by class "AllSplit", distance 2                         # NX
# Class "ManualSplit", by class "AllSplit", distance 2                       # X
# Class "CumulativeCutSplit", by class "VarStaticCutSplit", distance 2       # X via make_static_cut_split
# Class "AnalyzeVarSplit", by class "VAnalyzeSplit", distance 2         # Virtual
# Class "AnalyzeColVarSplit", by class "VAnalyzeSplit", distance 2           # X
# Class "AnalyzeMultiVars", by class "CompoundSplit", distance 2             # X
# Class "VarLevWBaselineSplit", by class "VarLevelSplit", distance 3         # NX
```

This can be updated only by related layout functions. The most important, that are covered by tests are `analyze` and `split_rows_by`.

Now it is relevant to understand where this information is saved in the table object built by `build_table`. To do that we need to see where it is present and how it is assigned. Let's go back to `00tabletree.R`and look for `trailing_section_div`. As classes definitions goes, you will notice from the search that `trailing_section_div` is present in the virtual classes `TableRow` and `VTableTree`. In the following is the class hierarchy that makes `trailing_section_div:

```{r}
getClass("TableRow")
# Extends:
# Class "VLeaf", directly
# Class "VTableNodeInfo", directly
# Class "VNodeInfo", by class "VLeaf", distance 2
#
# Known Subclasses: "DataRow", "ContentRow", "LabelRow"

getClass("VTableTree")
# Extends:
# Class "VTableNodeInfo", directly
# Class "VTree", directly
# Class "VTitleFooter", directly
# Class "VNodeInfo", by class "VTableNodeInfo", distance 2
#
# Known Subclasses: "ElementaryTable", "TableTree"
```

Always check the constructors after finding the classes. In the above case for example, the `DataRow` and `ContentRow` share the constructor, so we do not need to add identical getter and setters for these two classes but only for the virtual class `TableRow`. Different is the story for `LabelRow` which needs to be handle differently. Now, to understand why only these two have this feature, lets see the structure of a table built with section dividers:

```{r}
lyt <- basic_table() %>%
  split_rows_by("ARM", section_div = "+") %>%
  split_rows_by("STRATA1", section_div = "") %>%
  analyze("AGE",
    afun = function(x) list("Mean" = mean(x), "Standard deviation" = sd(x)),
    format = list("Mean" = "xx.", "Standard deviation" = "xx."),
    section_div = "~"
  )

tbl <- build_table(lyt, DM)

print(tbl)
print(class(tbl)) # TableTree
# methods("trailing_section_div") # to see this please do devtools::load_all()
# [1] trailing_section_div,LabelRow-method
# trailing_section_div,TableRow-method
# trailing_section_div,VTableTree-method
```

In the above, we show that `trailing_section_div` has methods for `TableRow` virtual object, `LabelRow`, and `VTableTree`. These three make the whole `section_div` structure as the `VTableTree` is present in `TableTree` and `ElementaryTable` that are the two main table objects. If these are not `NA_character_` then the `section_div` is printed at split divisions. The `LabelRow` and `TableRow` are different as their assignment allows the row-wise modification of separators. When we have a special case for a `ContentRow`, as it is represented as `content_table(obj)` which is a one-line `ElementaryTable`, while label row is turned off. Please take a moment to check the following setter:

```r{eval=FALSE}
setMethod("section_div<-", "VTableTree", function(obj, value, only_sep_sections = FALSE) {
  char_v <- as.character(value)
  tree_depths <- unname(vapply(collect_leaves(obj), tt_level, numeric(1)))
  max_tree_depth <- max(tree_depths)
  stopifnot(is.logical(only_sep_sections))
  .check_char_vector_for_section_div(char_v, max_tree_depth, nrow(obj))

  # Automatic establishment of intent
  if (length(char_v) < nrow(obj)) {
    only_sep_sections <- TRUE
  }

  # Case where only separators or splits need to change externally
  if (only_sep_sections && length(char_v) < nrow(obj)) {
    if (length(char_v) == 1) {
      char_v <- rep(char_v, max_tree_depth - 1) # -1 is the data row
    }
    # Case where char_v is longer than the max depth
    char_v <- char_v[seq_len(min(max_tree_depth, length(char_v)))]
    # Filling up with NAs the rest of the tree depth section div chr vector
    missing_char_v_len <- max_tree_depth - length(char_v)
    char_v <- c(char_v, rep(NA_character_, missing_char_v_len))
    # char_v <- unlist(
    #   lapply(tree_depths, function(tree_depth_i) char_v[seq_len(tree_depth_i)]),
    #   use.names = FALSE
    # )
  }

  # Retrieving if it is a contentRow (no need for labelrow to be visible in this case)
  content_row_tbl <- content_table(obj)
  is_content_table <- isS4(content_row_tbl) && nrow(content_row_tbl) > 0

  # Main table structure change
  if (labelrow_visible(obj) || is_content_table) {
    if (only_sep_sections) {
      # Only tables are modified
      trailing_section_div(tt_labelrow(obj)) <- NA_character_
      trailing_section_div(obj) <- char_v[1]
      section_div(tree_children(obj), only_sep_sections = only_sep_sections) <- char_v[-1]
    } else {
      # All leaves are modified
      trailing_section_div(tt_labelrow(obj)) <- char_v[1]
      trailing_section_div(obj) <- NA_character_
      section_div(tree_children(obj), only_sep_sections = only_sep_sections) <- char_v[-1]
    }
  } else {
    section_div(tree_children(obj), only_sep_sections = only_sep_sections) <- char_v
  }
  obj
})
```

`only_sep_sections` is a parameter that is used to change only the separators (between splits) and not the data rows. It is happening forcefully if set to `TRUE`, but it is automatically activated when `section_div(tbl) <- char_v` is a character vector of length `< nrow(tbl)`. Notice that the exception for `ContentRow` is activated by the switcher `is_content_table`. This is because content rows do not have visible label row. You see that in the main table structure change we have two blocks depending on `only_sep_sections`. If `TRUE` only the `VTableTree` are modified leading to only split section separators to be modified. Also consider looking at `section_div` getter and tests in `test-accessors.R` to have more insights on the structure. Also to understand exactly how this is bound to output, please check the result of `make_row_df()` for the column `trailing_sep`. Indeed, an alternative and iterative method is used by `make_row_df` to retrieve the information about the separators for each table row. Being it a trailing separator by definition, we added `header_section_div` as a function and a parameter of `basic_table`, so to possibly add an empty line after the header (e.g. `header_section_div(tbl) = " "`). This is not a trailing separator, but it is a separator that is added after the header. To close the circle, please check how `trailing_sep` and `header_section_div` is propagated and printed/used in `formatters::toString`.
