## Disclaimer

In comparison to other entries of the developer guide, this is intended to keep track of the general concepts and processing pipeline behind the printing machinery. It is not intended to be a complete documentation of the machinery itself, but rather a collection of notes that can be used to understand the machinery and its internals. Hence, be aware that this is a working document that captures a snapshot of the machinery at a certain point in time. It is not meant to be fully maintained, but it can be used as a starting point for one. Compared to other parts of the developer guide, this will contain the current state of `rlistings`' printing machinery, which is often a simplified version of the machinery that is used in `rtables`.


### How `print` works

Lets track down what is going under the hood when a standard table is printed. The following is the code that is executed when a table is printed:

```{r}
library(rtables)
library(dplyr)
lyt <- basic_table() %>%
  split_rows_by("SEX", split_fun = keep_split_levels(c("F", "M"))) %>%
  split_cols_by("ARM") %>%
  analyze("BMRKR1") %>%
  print()
tbl <- build_table(lyt, ex_adsl) %>%
  print()
```

We see that also a layout object (`PreDataTableLayouts`) is created and printed. This is because `print` is a generic function that dispatches to different methods depending on the class of the object. In this case, the S4 class of the object is `PreDataTableLayouts` and the method that is called is `print`. In the case of {rtables} the method is dispatched towards the `show` method of the class `PreDataTableLayouts`. It can be found by searching `A Pre-data Table Layout` into {rtables} source code. I think R dispatcher for `print` methods looks for `show` S4 methods instead if there are no S3 or S4 `print` methods available. Indeed, this is the code that is executed:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
setMethod(
  "show", "PreDataTableLayouts",
  function(object) {
    cat("A Pre-data Table Layout\n")
    cat("\nColumn-Split Structure:\n")
    docat_predataxis(object@col_layout)
    cat("\nRow-Split Structure:\n")
    docat_predataxis(object@row_layout)
    cat("\n")
    invisible(object)
  }
)
```

This was evident if we searched for methods associated with the class `PreDataTableLayouts`, where only `show` is connected to a sort of printing machinery:

```{r}
methods(class = "PreDataTableLayouts")
```

Now, lets see the same for our result table `tbl`: 

```{r}
class(tbl) %>% print()

getClass("TableTree") %>% print() # Main object representing a table in {rtables}

methods(class = "TableTree") %>% print() # more than 70 methods but no print method
```

Again, the class itself has only the `show` method. Nonetheless, if you search for `VTableTree"` you will find the `print` method for the `TableTree` class. This is because `VTableTree` is a virtual class that is inherited by `TableTree` and is almost identical to the `show` method for `TableTree` objects. All the different statements in this case (`show` or `print`) do the same thing, i.e. they call `toString` and `cat` on the object. Hence, we know that every table is printed by `toString` with `\n` as separator for different lines so that `cat` renders it in its final format.

### From `matrix_form` to `toString`

If we have source code of `formatters`, `rtables`, and `rlistings` in our local we can search for `"toString"` S4 method definition across these source folders. We will find generics in `formatters` and three different `setMethod(...)`. `toString` is properly defined in `formatters`, but it is also present in `rlistings` and`rtables`. Let's take a look at the latter first. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
setMethod("toString", "VTableTree", function(x,
                                             widths = NULL,
                                             col_gap = 3,
                                             hsep = horizontal_sep(x),
                                             indent_size = 2,
                                             tf_wrap = FALSE,
                                             max_width = NULL) {
  toString(
    matrix_form(x,
      indent_rownames = TRUE,
      indent_size = indent_size # Only modifies the rownames in matrix_form
    ),
    widths = widths, col_gap = col_gap,
    hsep = hsep,
    tf_wrap = tf_wrap,
    max_width = max_width
  )
})
```

This is only a wrapper/dispatcher to the core `toString` function in `formatters`, beside the `indent_size` specification. This is based on the "rendering-ready" class `MatrixPrintForm` that is produced by `matrix_form`. The latter is the first core transformation that we need to know to understand the printing process. All exporters and printers are based on `MatrixPrintForm` objects, hence any bug or problem needs to tracked down to this function or `toString`. If we take a look at `toString` for `"listing_df"` in `rlistings`, we will find a shallow wrapper that dispatches to `MatrixPrintForm` objects:

```{r, eval=FALSE} 
setMethod("toString", "listing_df", function(x, ...) {
  toString(matrix_form(x), ...)
})
```

Hence lets take a look at `"matrix_form"` (if there are quotes, it is an S4 function from now on). Beside generics and self calls (`setMethod("matrix_form", "MatrixPrintForm", [...] obj)`), `rlistings` and `rtables` have their own "constructor" of `MatrixPrintForm` (the real one can be found in `formatters`). Let's start with the latter `"matrix_form"` which is dispatched when dealing with `VTableTree`s.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Entering matrix_form for VTableTree
trace("matrix_form", signature = "VTableTree", tracer = browser, exit = browser)
matrix_form(tbl)
untrace("matrix_form", signature = "VTableTree")
```

Now lets see the newly commented code for `matrix_form`. With `#->` I will comment some suggestions for further understandings.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
setMethod(
  "matrix_form", "VTableTree",
  function(obj,
           indent_rownames = FALSE,
           expand_newlines = TRUE,
           indent_size = 2) {
    stopifnot(is(obj, "VTableTree"))

    #-> Read .tbl_header_mat and subfunctions (based largely on cinfo) it can help for understanding
    #   column structure and how it is printed (we can add a description of this process xxx)
    #   Note: it contains the display of column counts directives and specifics
    header_content <- .tbl_header_mat(obj) # first col are for row.names or topleft info
    nr_header <- nrow(header_content$body) # colcounts were added in .tbl_header_mat

    #-> As before, reading this function can help understanding how the content of the table is transformed
    #   in row content and how the structure of the table is preserved in a compact manner. It is complex
    #   function as it is a recursive one with the different dispatcher but following how different section_div
    #   are printed (with the dedicated assignment function) can help understanding the table structure and its
    #   row-wise transformation.
    # Summary of row contents - reprint_inds specifies which rows to reprint (hence the grouping)
    sr <- make_row_df(obj)

    # With get_formatted_cells we get relevant information inside the table tree
    body_content_strings <- if (NROW(sr) == 0) {
      character()
    } else {
      #-> get_formatted_cells is an interesting function to understand the structure of the table as
      #   it is design to extract only the "data" of the table as strings. Note how the label rows are
      #   taken from make_row_df instead. Check shell = TRUE afterwards to see how the format are retrieved.
      cbind(as.character(sr$label), get_formatted_cells(obj))
    }

    formats_strings <- if (NROW(sr) == 0) {
      character()
    } else {
      cbind("", get_formatted_cells(obj, shell = TRUE))

    }

    body_aligns <- if (NROW(sr) == 0) {
      character()
    } else {
      cbind("left", get_cell_aligns(obj)) #-> extracts align values for each cell
    }

    body <- rbind(header_content$body, body_content_strings)

    # Init column format for header (empty if not for column counts)
    hdr_fmt_blank <- matrix("",

      ),
      body_aligns
    )

    aligns[, 1] <- "left" # row names and topleft (still needed for topleft)

    # Main indentation of the table rownames #-> Main indentation facility
    if (indent_rownames) {

      nrow = nrow(body),

    )

    # Solve \n in titles # This is something that is relevant in toString - NO MORE USED HERE

    #-> this is still under development as indicated by xxx. The idea is to allow \n also in peculiar

```

Now lets see the `matrix_form` in `rlistings`:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(rlistings)
lsting <- as_listing(mtcars)
trace("matrix_form", signature = "listing_df", tracer = browser, exit = browser)
mf <- matrix_form(lsting)
untrace("matrix_form", signature = "listing_df")
```


```{r, eval=FALSE}
setMethod(
  "matrix_form", "listing_df",
  rix_form <- function(obj, indent_rownames = FALSE) { #-> I have no idea why here there is an assignment xxx
    ##  we intentionally silently ignore indent_rownames because listings have
    ## no rownames, but formatters::vert_pag_indices calls matrix_form(obj, TRUE)
    ## unconditionally.


    # Keeping only displayed columns
    cols <- attr(obj, "listing_dispcols") # this is the list of columns to be displayed
    listing <- obj[, cols]
    atts <- attributes(obj)
    atts$names <- cols
    attributes(listing) <- atts
    keycols <- get_keycols(listing)


    bodymat <- matrix("",
      nrow = nrow(listing),
      ncol = ncol(listing)
    )

    colnames(bodymat) <- names(listing)


    # Print only first appearer of key columns if repeated
    curkey <- ""
    for (i in seq_along(keycols)) {
      kcol <- keycols[i]
      kcolvec <- listing[[kcol]]
      #-> format_value transforms the values of the column into strings
      kcolvec <- vapply(kcolvec, format_value, "", format = obj_format(kcolvec), na_str = obj_na_str(kcolvec))

      disp <- c(TRUE, tail(curkey, -1) != head(curkey, -1)) #-> This condition only show the first appearer of a key
      bodymat[disp, kcol] <- kcolvec[disp]
    }

    # Print all other columns directly
    nonkeycols <- setdiff(names(listing), keycols)
    if (length(nonkeycols) > 0) {
      for (nonk in nonkeycols) {
        vec <- listing[[nonk]]
        vec <- vapply(vec, format_value, "", format = obj_format(vec), na_str = obj_na_str(vec))
        bodymat[, nonk] <- vec
      }
    }


    fullmat <- rbind(
      var_labels(listing, fill = TRUE), # Extracts the variable labels
      bodymat
    )

    colaligns <- rbind(
      rep("center", length(cols)), # Col names are always centered?
      matrix(sapply(listing, obj_align),
        ncol = length(cols),
        nrow = nrow(fullmat) - 1,
        byrow = TRUE
      )
    )

    MatrixPrintForm(
      strings = fullmat,
      spans = matrix(1,
        nrow = nrow(fullmat),
        ncol = ncol(fullmat)
      ),
      ref_fnotes = list(),
      aligns = colaligns,
      formats = matrix(1,
        nrow = nrow(fullmat),
        ncol = ncol(fullmat)
      ),
      row_info = make_row_df(obj),
      nlines_header = 1, ## XXX this is probably wrong!!!
      nrow_header = 1,
      has_topleft = FALSE,
      has_rowlabs = FALSE,
      expand_newlines = TRUE, # Always expand newlines, but this happens later!! XXX to fix
      main_title = main_title(obj),
      subtitles = subtitles(obj),
      page_titles = page_titles(obj),
      main_footer = main_footer(obj),
      prov_footer = prov_footer(obj)
    )
  }
)
```

We device here the good developer to search and understand the various methods associated with `MatrixPrintForm` objects. It is relevant to remember how this printed form is meant to 

```{r}
# Example quick table
summary_list <- function(x, ...) as.list(summary(x))
a_table <- qtable(ex_adsl, row_vars = "SEX", col_vars = "ARM", avar = "AGE", afun = summary_list)
tbl_methods <- methods(class = class(a_table))
mpf_methods <- methods(class = class(matrix_form(a_table))[1]) # it is a list of values

# Cleaning values
tbl_methods <- unique(sapply(strsplit(tbl_methods, ","), function(x) x[1]))
mpf_methods <- unique(sapply(strsplit(mpf_methods, ","), function(x) x[1]))
setdiff(tbl_methods, mpf_methods)
setdiff(mpf_methods, tbl_methods) # much less unique methods
intersect(tbl_methods, mpf_methods) # interesting to discover the different behaviors of same functions
```

Let's now take a look at the final function of all this: `toString` from `formatters`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
setMethod("toString", "MatrixPrintForm", function(x,
                                                  widths = NULL,
                                                  tf_wrap = FALSE,
                                                  max_width = NULL,
                                                  col_gap = mf_colgap(x),
                                                  hsep = NULL,
                                                  fontspec = font_spec(),
                                                  ttype_ok = FALSE) {
  # part 1: checks and widths/max width estimation for columns - propose_column_widths and .handle_max_width
  #
  # part 2: wrapping for the table - do_cell_fnotes_wrap
  #
  # part 3: column gap and cell widths calculations (after wrapping) - .calc_cell_widths
  #
  # part 4: collapse text body and wrapping titles/footers
  #
  # part 5: final cat()
})
```

We rely on the future developer to fill in the blanks in the above description and to follow up the various functions to their core mechanics.
