This vignette is currently under development. Any code or prose which
appears in a version of this vignette on the `main` branch of the
repository will work/be correct, but they likely are not in their
final form.


## The Split Machinery

The scope of this vignette is understanding how `rtables` creates facets by splitting the incoming data into hierarchical groups that go from the root node to singular `rcell`s. The latter level, also called leaf-level, contains the final partition that is subjected to the analysis functions.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(rtables)
```

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
