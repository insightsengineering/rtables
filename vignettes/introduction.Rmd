## Introduction

The `rtables` R package provides a framework to create, tabulate and output tables in `R`. Most of the design requirements for `rtables` have their origin in studying tables that are commonly used to report analyses from clinical trials; however, we were careful to keep `rtables` a general purpose toolkit.

There are a number of other table frameworks available in `R` such as [gt](https://gt.rstudio.com/) from RStudio, [xtable](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=xtable), [tableone](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tableone), and [tables](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tables) to name a few. There is a number of reasons to implement `rtables` (yet another tables R package):

* output tables in ASCII to text files
* `rtables` has two powerful tabulation frameworks: `rtabulate` and the layouting based tabulation framework
* table view (ASCII, HTML, etc.) is separate from the data model. Hence, one always has access to the non-rounded/non-formatted numbers.
* pagination in both horizontal and vertical directions to meet the health authority submission requirements
* cell, row, column, table reference system
* titles, footers, and referential footnotes
* path based access to cell content which will be useful for automated content generation

In the remainder of this vignette, we give a short introduction into `rtables` and tabulating a table. The content is based on the [useR 2020 presentation from Gabriel Becker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBQzZ8ZhXLA).

The packages used for this vignette are `rtables` and `dplyr`:

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(rtables)
library(dplyr)
```

## Data 

The data used in this vignette is a made up using random number generators. The data content is relatively simple: one row per imaginary person and one column per measurement: study arm, the country of origin, gender, handedness, age, and weight.

```{r data}
n <- 400

set.seed(1)

df <- tibble(
  arm = factor(sample(c("Arm A", "Arm B"), n, replace = TRUE), levels = c("Arm A", "Arm B")),
  country = factor(sample(c("CAN", "USA"), n, replace = TRUE, prob = c(.55, .45)), levels = c("CAN", "USA")),
  gender = factor(sample(c("Female", "Male"), n, replace = TRUE), levels = c("Female", "Male")),
  handed = factor(sample(c("Left", "Right"), n, prob = c(.6, .4), replace = TRUE), levels = c("Left", "Right")),
  age = rchisq(n, 30) + 10
) %>% mutate(
  weight = 35 * rnorm(n, sd = .5) + ifelse(gender == "Female", 140, 180)
)

head(df)
```

Note that we use factors variables so that the level order is represented in the row or column order when we tabulate the information of `df` below.


## Building an Table

The aim of this vignette is to build the following table step by step:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
basic_table() %>%
  split_cols_by("arm") %>%
  split_cols_by("gender") %>%
  add_colcounts() %>%
  split_rows_by("country") %>%
  summarize_row_groups() %>%
  split_rows_by("handed") %>%
  summarize_row_groups() %>%
  analyze("age", afun = mean, format = "xx.x") %>%
  build_table(df)
```

## Starting Simple

In `rtables` a basic table is defined to have 0 rows and one column representing all data. Analyzing a variable is one way of adding a row:

```{r}
l <- basic_table() %>%
  analyze("age", mean, format = "xx.x")

build_table(l, df)
```


### Layout Instructions

In the code above we first described the table and assigned that description to a variable `l`. We then built the table using the actual data with `build_table()`. The description of a table is called a table layout. `basic_table()` is the start of every table layout and contains the information that we have one column representing all data. The `analyze()` instruction adds to the layout that the `age` variable should be analyzed with the `mean()` analysis function and the result should be rounded to `1` decimal place.

Hence, a layout is "pre-data", that is, it's a description of how to build a table once we get data. We can look at the layout isolated: 

```{r}
l
```

The general layouting instructions are summarized below:

* `basic_table()` is a layout representing a table with zero rows and one column
* Nested splitting
  - in row space: `split_rows_by()`, `split_rows_by_multivar()`, `split_rows_by_cuts()`, `split_rows_by_cutfun()`, `split_rows_by_quartiles()`
  - in column space: `split_cols_by()`, `split_cols_by_multivar()`, `split_cols_by_cuts()`, `split_cols_by_cutfun()`, `split_cols_by_quartiles()`
* Summarizing Groups: `summarize_row_groups()`
* Analyzing Variables: `analyze()`, `analyze_colvars()`

using those functions it is possible to create a wide variety of tables as we will show in this document.


### Adding Column Structure

We will now add more structure to the columns by adding a column split based on the factor variable `arm`:


```{r}
l <- basic_table() %>%
  split_cols_by("arm") %>%
  analyze("age", afun = mean, format = "xx.x")

build_table(l, df)
```

The resulting table has one column per factor level of `arm`. So the data represented by the first column is `df[df$arm == "ARM A", ]`. Hence, the `split_cols_by()` partitions the data among the columns by default. 

Column splitting can be done in a recursive/nested manner by adding sequential `split_cols_by()` layout instruction. It's also possible to add a non-nested split. Here we splitting each arm further by the gender:

```{r}
l <- basic_table() %>%
  split_cols_by("arm") %>%
  split_cols_by("gender") %>%
  analyze("age", afun = mean, format = "xx.x")

build_table(l, df)
```

The first column represents the data in `df` where `df$arm == "A" & df$gender == "Female"` and the second column the data in `df` where `df$arm == "A" & df$gender == "Male"`, and so on.

### Adding Row Structure

So far, we have created layouts with analysis and column splitting instructions, i.e. `analyze()` and `split_cols_by()`, respectively. This resulted with a table with multiple columns and one data row. We will add more row structure by stratifying the mean analysis by country (i.e. adding a split in the row space):

```{r}
l <- basic_table() %>%
  split_cols_by("arm") %>%
  split_cols_by("gender") %>%
  split_rows_by("country") %>%
  analyze("age", afun = mean, format = "xx.x")

build_table(l, df)
```

In this table the data used to derive the first data cell (average of age of female Canadians in Arm A) is  where `df$country == "CAN" & df$arm == "Arm A" & df$gender == "Female"`. This cell value can also be calculated manually:

```{r}
mean(df$age[df$country == "CAN" & df$arm == "Arm A" & df$gender == "Female"])
```

### Adding Group Information

When adding row splits we get by default label rows for each split level, for example `CAN` and `USA` in the table above. Besides the column space subsetting, we have now further subsetted the data for each cell. It is often useful when defining a row splitting to display information about each row group. In `rtables` this is referred to as content information, i.e. `mean()` on row 2 is a descendant of `CAN` (visible via the indenting, though the table has an underlying tree structure that is not of importance for this vignette). In order to add content information and turn the `CAN` label row into a content row the `summarize_row_groups()` function is required. By default, the count (`nrows()`) and percentage of data relative to the column associated data is calculated:

```{r}
l <- basic_table() %>%
  split_cols_by("arm") %>%
  split_cols_by("gender") %>%
  split_rows_by("country") %>%
  summarize_row_groups() %>%
  analyze("age", afun = mean, format = "xx.x")

build_table(l, df)
```

The relative percentage for average age of female Canadians is calculated as follows:

```{r}
df_cell <- subset(df, df$country == "CAN" & df$arm == "Arm A" & df$gender == "Female")
df_col_1 <- subset(df, df$arm == "Arm A" & df$gender == "Female")

c(count = nrow(df_cell), percentage = nrow(df_cell) / nrow(df_col_1))
```

so the group percentages per row split sum up to 1 for each column. 

We can further split the row space by dividing each country by handedness:

```{r}
l <- basic_table() %>%
  split_cols_by("arm") %>%
  split_cols_by("gender") %>%
  split_rows_by("country") %>%
  summarize_row_groups() %>%
  split_rows_by("handed") %>%
  analyze("age", afun = mean, format = "xx.x")

build_table(l, df)
```

Next, we further add a count and percentage summary for handedness within each country:

```{r}
l <- basic_table() %>%
  split_cols_by("arm") %>%
  split_cols_by("gender") %>%
  split_rows_by("country") %>%
  summarize_row_groups() %>%
  split_rows_by("handed") %>%
  summarize_row_groups() %>%
  analyze("age", afun = mean, format = "xx.x")

tbl <- build_table(l, df)
tbl
```

## Introspecting `rtables` Table Objects

Once we have created a table, we can inspect its structure using a
number of functions. 

The `table_structure()` function prints a summary of a table's row structure
at one of two levels of detail. By default, it summarizes the structure at the 
subtable level. 

```{r}
table_structure(tbl)
```

When the `detail` argument is set to `"row"`, however, it provides a more detailed
row-level summary, which acts as a useful alternative to how we might normally
use the `str()` function to interrogate compound nested lists.

```{r}
table_structure(tbl, detail = "row")
```

The `make_row_df()` and `make_col_df()` functions create a data.frame
which has a variety of information about the table's structure. Most
useful for introspection purposes are the `label`, `name`,
`abs_rownumber`, `path` and `node_class` columns (the remainder of information in
the returned data.frame is used for pagination)

```{r}
make_row_df(tbl)[,c("label", "name", "abs_rownumber", "path", "node_class")]
```

By default `make_row_df()` summarizes only visible rows, but setting `visible_only` to 
`FALSE` gives us a structural summary of the table, including the full hierarchy of subtables,
including those that aren't represented directly by any visible rows:

```{r}
make_row_df(tbl, visible_only = FALSE)[,c("label", "name", "abs_rownumber", "path", "node_class")]
```

`make_col_df()` similarly accepts `visible_only`, though here the meaining is slightly different, indicating
whether only *leaf* columns should be summarized (`TRUE`, the default) or whether higher level groups of columns,
analogous to subtables in row space, should be summarized as well.

```{r}
make_col_df(tbl)
```

```{r}
make_col_df(tbl, visible_only = FALSE)
```

The `row_paths_summary()` and `col_paths_summary()` functions wrap the
respective `make_*_df` functions, printing the `name`, `node_class`
and `path` information (in the row case), or the `label` and `path`
information (in the column case), indented to illustrate table
structure:

```{r}
row_paths_summary(tbl)
```


```{r}
col_paths_summary(tbl)
```






## Summary

In this vignette you have learned:

* every cell has an associated subset of data
   * this means that much of tabulation has to do with splitting/subsetting data
* tables can be described pre-data using layouts
* tables are a form of visualization of data

The other vignettes in the `rtables` package will provide more detailed information about the `rtables` package. We recommend that you continue with the [`tabulation_dplyr`](https://roche.github.io/rtables/articles/tabulation_dplyr.html) vignette which compares the information derived by the table in this vignette using `dplyr`.
