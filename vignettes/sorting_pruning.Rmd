## Introduction

Often we want to filter or reorder elements of a table
in ways that take into account the table structure. For example:

- Sorting subtables corresponding to factor levels so that most
  commonly observed levels occur first in the table.
- Sorting rows within a single subtable
- Removing subtables which represent 0 observations or which after
  other filtering contain 0 rows.

## A Table In Need of Attention

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(rtables)
library(dplyr)

raw_lyt <- basic_table() %>%
  split_cols_by("ARM") %>%
  split_cols_by("SEX") %>%
  split_rows_by("RACE") %>%
  summarize_row_groups() %>%
  split_rows_by("STRATA1") %>%
  summarize_row_groups() %>%
  analyze("AGE")

raw_tbl <- build_table(raw_lyt, DM)
raw_tbl
```

## Trimming

### Trimming Rows

Trimming represents a convenience wrapper around simple, direct
subsetting of the rows of a `TableTree`.

We use the `trim_rows()` function with our table and a criteria
function. All rows where the criteria function returns `TRUE` will be
removed, and all others will be retained.

**NOTE**: Each row is kept or removed completely independently, with
no awareness of the surrounding structure. This means, for example,
that a subtree could have all its analysis rows removed and not be
removed itself. For structure-aware filtering of a table, we will use
*pruning* described in the next section.

A *trimming function* accepts a `TableRow` object and returns `TRUE`
if the row should be removed.

The default trimming function removes rows in which all columns have
no values in them, i.e. that have all `NA` values or all `0` values:

```{r}
trim_rows(raw_tbl)
```

### Trimming Columns

There are currently no special utilities for trimming columns but we
can remove the empty columns with fairly straightforward column
subsetting using the `col_counts()` function:

```{r}
coltrimmed <- raw_tbl[, col_counts(raw_tbl) > 0]
h_coltrimmed <- head(coltrimmed, n = 14)
h_coltrimmed
```

Now, it is interesting to see how this table is structured:

```{r}
table_structure(h_coltrimmed)
```

For a deeper understanding of the fundamental structures in `rtables`,
we suggest taking a look at slides 69-76 of this [Slide
deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ygQE9UaoXY6C_FiQLkiYtXB_OnkVbXvsMIY6_MQPbx0/edit?usp=sharing).

In brief, it is important to notice how `[TableTree] RACE` is the root
of the table that is split (with `split_rows_by("RACE") %>%`) into two
subtables: `[TableTree] ASIAN [cont: 1 x 6]` and `[TableTree] BLACK OR
AFRICAN AMERICAN [cont: 1 x 6]`. These are then "described" with
`summarize_row_groups() %>%`, which creates for every split a
"content" table containing 1 row (the 1 in `cont: 1 x 6`), which 
when rendered takes the place of `LabelRow`.


Each of these two subtables then contain a `STRATA1` table,
representing the further `split_rows_by("STRATA1")` in the layout,
which, similar to the `RACE` table, is split into subtables: one for
each strata which have similar content tables; Each individual strata
subtable, then, contains an `ElementaryTable` (whose children are
individual rows) generated by the `analyze("AGE")` layout directive,
i.e. `[ElementaryTable] AGE (1 x 6)`.

This subtable and row structure is very important for both sorting and
pruning; values in "content" (`ContentRow`) and "value" (`DataRow`)
rows use different access functions and they should be treated
differently.

Another interesting function that can be used to understand the
connection between row names and their representational path is the
following:

```{r}
row_paths_summary(h_coltrimmed)
```

## Pruning

Pruning is similar in outcome to trimming, but more powerful and more
complex, as it takes structure into account.

Pruning is applied recursively, in that at each structural unit
(subtable, row) it applies the pruning function both at that level and
to all it's children (up to a user-specifiable maximum depth).

The default pruning function, for example, determines if a subtree is
empty by:

1. Removing all children which contain a single content row which
   contains all zeros or all `NA`s
2. Removing rows which contain either all zeros or all `NA`s
3. Removing the full subtree if no unpruned children remain

```{r}
pruned <- prune_table(coltrimmed)
pruned
```

We can also use the `low_obs_pruner()` pruning function constructor to
create a pruning function which removes subtrees with content
summaries whose first entries for each column sum or average are below
a specified number. (In the default summaries the first entry per
column is the count).

```{r}
pruned2 <- prune_table(coltrimmed, low_obs_pruner(10, "mean"))
pruned2
```

Note that because the pruning is being applied recursively, only the
`ASIAN` subtree remains because even though the full `BLACK OR AFRICAN
AMERICAN` subtree encompassed enough observations, the strata within
it did not. We can take care of this by setting the `stop_depth` for
pruning to `1`.

```{r}
pruned3 <- prune_table(coltrimmed, low_obs_pruner(10, "sum"), stop_depth = 1)
pruned3
```

We can also see that pruning to a lower number of observations, say,
to a total of `16`, with no `stop_depth` removes some but not all of
the strata from our third race (`WHITE`).

```{r}
pruned4 <- prune_table(coltrimmed, low_obs_pruner(16, "sum"))
pruned4
```



## Sorting

### Sorting Fundamentals

Sorting of an `rtables` table is done **at a path**, meaning a sort
operation will occur at a particular location within the table, and
the *direct children* of the element at that path will be
reordered. This occurs whether those children are subtables
themselves, or individual rows.  Sorting is done via the
`sort_at_path()` function, which accepts both a (row) path and a
scoring function.

A *score function* accepts a subtree or `TableRow` and returns a
single orderable (typically numeric) value. Within the subtable
currently being sorted, the children are then reordered by the value
of the score function. Importantly, "content" (`ContentRow`) and
"values" (`DataRow`) need to be treated differently in the scoring
function as they are retrieved: the *content* of a subtable is
retrieved via the `content _table` accessor.

The `cont_n_allcols()` scoring function provided by `rtables`, works
by scoring subtables by the sum of the first elements in the first row
of the subtable's *content* table.  Note that this function fails if
the child being scored does not have a content function (i.e., if
`summarize_row_groups()` was not used at the corresponding point in the
layout). We can see this in it's definition, below:

```{r}
cont_n_allcols
```

Therefore, a fundamental difference between pruning and sorting is
that sorting occurs at particular places in the table, as defined by a
path.

For example, we can sort the strata values (`ContentRow`) by
observation counts within just the `ASIAN` subtable:

```{r}
sort_at_path(pruned, path = c("RACE", "ASIAN", "STRATA1"), scorefun = cont_n_allcols)
# B and C are swapped as the global count (sum of all column counts) of strata C is higher than the one of strata B
```

### Wildcards in Sort Paths

 Unlike other uses of pathing (currentl), a sorting path can contain
 "*". This indicates that the children of each subtable matching he
 `*` element of the path should be sorted **separately** as indicated
 by the remainder of the path after the `*` and the score function.

Thus we can extend our sorting of strata within the `ASIAN` subtable
to all race-specific subtables bjy using the wildcard:

```{r}
sort_at_path(pruned, path = c("RACE", "*", "STRATA1"), scorefun = cont_n_allcols)
# All subtables, i.e. ASIAN, BLACK..., and WHITE, are reordered separately
```

The above is equivalent to separately calling the following:

```{r}
tmptbl <- sort_at_path(pruned, path = c("RACE", "ASIAN", "STRATA1"), scorefun = cont_n_allcols)
tmptbl <- sort_at_path(tmptbl, path = c("RACE", "BLACK OR AFRICAN AMERICAN", "STRATA1"), scorefun = cont_n_allcols)
tmptbl <- sort_at_path(tmptbl, path = c("RACE", "WHITE", "STRATA1"), scorefun = cont_n_allcols)
tmptbl


```

It is possible to understand better pathing with `table_structure()`
that highlights the tree-like structure and the node names:

```{r}
table_structure(pruned)
```

or with `row_paths_summary`:

```{r}
row_paths_summary(pruned)
```

Note in the latter we see content rows as those with paths following
`@content`, e.g., `ASIAN, @content, ASIAN`. The first of these at 
a given path (i.e., `<path>, @content, <>` are the rows which will be
used by the scoring functions which begin with `cont_`.

We can directly sort the ethnicity by observations in increasing order:

```{r}
ethsort <- sort_at_path(pruned, path = c("RACE"), scorefun = cont_n_allcols, decreasing = FALSE)
ethsort
```

Within each ethnicity separately, sort the strata by number of females
in arm C (i.e. column position `5`):

```{r}
sort_at_path(pruned, path = c("RACE", "*", "STRATA1"), cont_n_onecol(5))
```

### Sorting Within an Analysis Subtable

When sorting within an analysis subtable (e.g., the subtable generated
when your analysis function generates more than one row per group of
data), the name of that subtable (generally the name of the variable
being analyzed) must appear in the path, _**even if the variable label
is not displayed when the table is printed**_.

To show the differences between sorting an analysis subtable
(`DataRow`), and a content subtable (`ContentRow`), we modify and
prune (as before) a similar raw table as before:

```{r}
more_analysis_fnc <- function(x) {
  in_rows(
    "median" = median(x),
    "mean" = mean(x),
    .formats = "xx.x"
  )
}

raw_lyt <- basic_table() %>%
  split_cols_by("ARM") %>%
  split_rows_by(
    "RACE",
    split_fun = drop_and_remove_levels("WHITE") # dropping WHITE levels
  ) %>%
  summarize_row_groups() %>%
  split_rows_by("STRATA1") %>%
  summarize_row_groups() %>%
  analyze("AGE", afun = more_analysis_fnc)

tbl <- build_table(raw_lyt, DM) %>%
  prune_table() %>%
  print()
```

What should we do now if we want to sort each median and mean in each
of the strata variables? We need to write a custom score function as
the ready-made ones at the moment work only with content nodes
(`content_table()` access function for `cont_n_allcols()` and
`cont_n_onecol()`, of which we will talk in a moment). But before
that, we need to think about what are we ordering, i.e. we need to
specify the right path. We suggest looking at the structure first with
`table_structure()` or `row_paths_summary()`.

```{r}
table_structure(tbl) # Direct inspection into the tree-like structure of rtables
```

We see that to order all of the `AGE` nodes we need to get there with
something like this: `RACE, ASIAN, STRATA1, A, AGE` and no more as the
next level is what we need to sort. But we see now that this path
would sort only the first group. We need wildcards: `RACE, *, STRATA1,
*, AGE`.

Now, we have found a way to select relevant paths that we want to
sort. We want to construct a scoring function that works on the median
and mean and sort them. To do so, we may want to enter our scoring
function with `browser()` to see what is fed to it and try to retrieve
the single value that is to be returned to do the sorting. We allow
the user to experiment with this, while here we show a possible
solution that considers summing all the column values that are
retrieved with `row_values(tt)` from the subtable that is fed to the
function itself. Note that any score function should be defined as
having a subtable `tt` as a unique input parameter and a single
numeric value as output.

```{r}
scorefun <- function(tt) {
  # Here we could use browser()
  sum(unlist(row_values(tt)))
}
sort_at_path(tbl, c("RACE", "*", "STRATA1", "*", "AGE"), scorefun)
```

To help the user visualize what is happening in the score function we
show here an example of its exploration from the debugging:

```
> sort_at_path(tbl, c("RACE", "*", "STRATA1", "*", "AGE"), scorefun)
Called from: scorefun(x)
Browse[1]> tt ### THIS IS THE LEAF LEVEL -> DataRow ###
[DataRow indent_mod 0]: median   30.0   33.0   36.0
Browse[1]> row_values(tt) ### Extraction of values -> It will be a named list! ###
$`A: Drug X`
[1] 30

$`B: Placebo`
[1] 33

$`C: Combination`
[1] 36

Browse[1]> sum(unlist(row_values(tt))) ### Final value we want to give back to sort_at_path ###
[1] 99
```

We can see how powerful and pragmatic it might be to change the
sorting principles from within the custom scoring function. We show
this by selecting a specific column to sort. Looking at the
pre-defined function `cont_n_onecol()` gives us an insight into how to
proceed.

```{r}
cont_n_onecol
```

We see that a similar function to `cont_n_allcols()` is wrapped by one
that allows a parameter `j` to be used to select a specific column. We
will do the same here for selecting which column we want to sort.

```{r}
scorefun_onecol <- function(colpath) {
  function(tt) {
    # Here we could use browser()
    unlist(cell_values(tt, colpath = colpath), use.names = FALSE)[1] # Modified to lose the list names
  }
}
sort_at_path(tbl, c("RACE", "*", "STRATA1", "*", "AGE"),
             scorefun_onecol(colpath = c("ARM", "A: Drug X")))
```

In the above table we see that the mean and median rows are reordered
by their values in the first column, comparead to the raw table, as
desired.

With this function we can also do the same for columns that are nested
within larger splits:

```{r}
# Simpler table
tbl <- basic_table() %>%
  split_cols_by("ARM") %>%
  split_cols_by("SEX",
    split_fun = drop_and_remove_levels(c("U", "UNDIFFERENTIATED"))
  ) %>%
  analyze("AGE", afun = more_analysis_fnc) %>%
  build_table(DM) %>%
  prune_table() %>%
  print()

sort_at_path(tbl, c("AGE"),
             scorefun_onecol(colpath = c("ARM", "B: Placebo", "SEX", "F")))
```



# Writing Custom Pruning Criteria and Scoring Functions

Pruning criteria and scoring functions map `TableTree` or `TableRow`
objects to a Boolean value (for pruning criteria) or a sortable scalar
value (scoring functions). To do this we currently need to interact
with the structure of the objects more than usual. Indeed, we showed
already how sorting can be very complicated if the concept of
tree-like structure and pathing is not well understood. It is
important though to have in mind the following functions that can be
used in each pruning or sorting function to retrieve the relevant
information from the table.

## Useful Functions and Accessors

- `cell_values()` - Retrieves a named list of a `TableRow` or
  `TableTree` object's values
  - accepts both `rowpath` and `colpath` to restrict which cell values
    are returned
- `obj_name()` - Retrieves the name of an object. Note this can differ
  from the label that is displayed (if any is) when printing. This
  will match the element in the path.
- `obj_label()` - Retrieves the display label of an object. Note this
  can differ from the name that appears in the path.
- `content_table()` - Retrieves a `TableTree` object's content table
  (which contains its summary rows).
- `tree_children()` - Retrieves a `TableTree` object's direct children
  (either subtables, rows or possibly a mix thereof, though that
  should not happen in practice)

## Example Custom Scoring Functions

### Sort by a character "score"

In this case, for convenience/simplicity, we use the name of the table
element but any logic which returns a single string could be used
here.

We sort the ethnicity by alphabetical order (in practice undoing our
previous sorting by ethnicity above).

```{r}
silly_name_scorer <- function(tt) {
  nm <- obj_name(tt)
  print(nm)
  nm
}

sort_at_path(ethsort, "RACE", silly_name_scorer) # Now, it is sorted alphabetically!
```

**NOTE**: Generally this would be more appropriately done using the
`reorder_split_levels()` function within the layout rather than as a
sort post-processing step, but other character scorers may or may not
map as easily to layouting directives.

### Sort by the Percent Difference in Counts Between Genders in Arm C

We need the F and M percents, only for Arm C (i.e. columns 5 and 6),
differenced.

We will sort _**the strata within each ethnicity**_ by the percent
difference in counts between males and females in arm C. 

Note: this is not statistically meaningful at all, and is in fact a
terrible idea because it reorders the strata seemingly (but not) at
random within each race, but illustrates the various things we need to
do inside custom sorting functions.


```{r}
silly_gender_diffcount <- function(tt) {
  ## (1st) content row has same name as object (STRATA1 level)
  rpath <- c(obj_name(tt), "@content", obj_name(tt))
  ## the [1] below is cause these are count (pct%) cells
  ## and we only want the count part!
  mcount <- unlist(cell_values(tt, rowpath = rpath,
                               colpath = c("ARM", "C: Combination", "SEX", "M")))[1]
  fcount <- unlist(cell_values(tt, rowpath = rpath,
                               colpath = c("ARM", "C: Combination", "SEX", "F")))[1]
  (mcount - fcount) / fcount
}

sort_at_path(pruned, c("RACE", "*", "STRATA1"), silly_gender_diffcount)
```
